This page documents the release history of LongtermWiki.

## How We Version

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions and generate changelogs. Each release follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes or major restructuring
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features or significant additions
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, content updates, and minor improvements

## Current Version

The current version is displayed in the footer of every page. It includes:
- The semantic version number (e.g., `0.1.0`)
- A git commit hash suffix (e.g., `+abc1234`) for precise build identification

## Release History
