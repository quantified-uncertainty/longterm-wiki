## Overview

This page lists all the interactive tables, matrices, and graph visualizations available in the knowledge base. These views provide different ways to explore and compare data across the project.

:::tip[Quick Access]
Visit the **[Tables Gallery](/tables/)** for a visual overview of all comparison tables, or **[Cause-Effect Diagrams](/diagrams/)** for interactive causal graphs.

## Intelligence Paradigms

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Architecture Scenarios Table](/knowledge-base/architecture-scenarios/table/) | Compare deployment patterns, base architectures, and non-AI paths to intelligence. Includes safety outlook ratings, research tractability, and key properties. |
| [Deployment Architectures Table](/knowledge-base/deployment-architectures/table/) | Compare how AI systems are deployed: API access, on-device, edge computing, etc. |

## Safety & Alignment

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Safety Generalizability Table](/knowledge-base/responses/safety-generalizability/table/) | Which safety approaches generalize across different AI architectures and deployment patterns. |
| [Safety × Architecture Matrix](/knowledge-base/responses/safety-generalizability/matrix/) | Matrix view showing compatibility between safety approaches and architecture scenarios. |
| [Safety Generalizability Graph](/knowledge-base/responses/safety-generalizability/graph/) | Graph visualization of safety approach relationships. |

## Risks

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Accident Risks Table](/ai-transition-model/table/) | Compare accident/misalignment risks by severity, likelihood, and detectability. |

## Evaluations

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Eval Types Table](/knowledge-base/models/eval-types/table/) | Compare different evaluation methodologies for AI systems. |

## AI Transition Model

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Master Graph](/diagrams/master-graph/) | Full causal graph of AI transition model factors and relationships. |
| [AI Transition Model Views](/ai-transition-model-views/) | Interactive exploration of the AI transition model. |

## Entity Diagrams

Individual entity pages may also have cause-effect diagrams. See the [Cause-Effect Demo](/guides/cause-effect-demo/) for examples of how these work.
