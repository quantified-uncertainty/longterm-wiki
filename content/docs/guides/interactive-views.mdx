| Safety Approaches | Safety research effectiveness vs capability uplift. 42 rows. | Data ported |
| Safety Generalizability | Safety approaches across AI architectures. 42 rows. | Data ported |
| Safety × Architecture Matrix | Safety approaches vs architecture scenarios. 42 rows. | Data ported |
| Architecture Scenarios | Deployment patterns and base architectures. 12 rows. | Data ported |
| Deployment Architectures | How AI systems are deployed. 8 rows. | Data ported |

Tables marked "Data ported" have their data files and column definitions in `app/src/data/tables/` and `app/src/components/tables/`, but don't yet have dedicated pages with interactive table views.

## Entity Diagrams

Individual entity pages include embedded cause-effect diagrams. Browse all diagrams via the [Explore page filtered by Diagrams](/wiki?entity=diagram). See the [Cause-Effect Demo](/wiki/cause-effect-demo) for examples of how these work.
