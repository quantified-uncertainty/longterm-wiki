## How It Works

The Quantitative Claims tool scans all MDX content for numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, and other quantitative data that could be extracted as standalone insights.

### Patterns Detected

| Type | Examples | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Percentages** | 40%, 30-50% | Success rates, probabilities, coverage |
| **Dollar Amounts** | \$1B, \$10 million | Research funding, market sizes, costs |
| **People Counts** | 500 researchers | Team sizes, community estimates |
| **Timelines** | by 2030, in 5 years | Predictions, forecasts |
| **Multipliers** | 10x, 3-fold | Performance gains, risk increases |
| **Probabilities** | 20% probability | Risk estimates, likelihood |
| **Large Numbers** | 100 billion | Scale metrics |

### Notable Claims

Claims are marked as "Notable" when their surrounding context contains importance indicators like:
- catastrophic, existential, critical
- surprising, unexpected, contrary
- only, merely, just (indicating scarcity)
- most, majority (indicating prevalence)
- unprecedented, first

## Generating the Data

The claims data is generated by running:

```bash
cd apps/longterm
node scripts/find-quantitative-claims.mjs
```

This scans all MDX files and outputs to `src/data/generated/quantitative-claims.json`.

Re-run this script periodically to capture new content.

## Using the Tool

1. **Filter by type** to focus on specific claim types (percentages, dollars, etc.)
2. **Toggle "Only notable"** to see claims with importance indicators
3. **Search** for specific topics or numbers
4. **Click through** to source pages to verify context
5. **Extract as insight** if the claim is surprising, important, and well-sourced

## Tips for Good Quantitative Insights

**Good candidates:**
- Specific percentages with clear methodology
- Dollar amounts that reveal priorities
- Timeline predictions from credible sources
- Multipliers that show scale of change

**Poor candidates:**
- Round numbers without sources (e.g., "about 50%")
- Dates that are just timestamps
- Numbers in code examples or technical specs
- Statistics already well-known in the field
