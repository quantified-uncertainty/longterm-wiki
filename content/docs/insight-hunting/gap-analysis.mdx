## How It Works

The Gap Analysis tool cross-references:
- **Page importance** (0-100 scale from pages.json)
- **Page quality** (0-100 scale)
- **Current insight count** (from insights.yaml)

Pages are scored using the formula:

```
Score = importance × (1 + quality/100) - insightCount × 20
```

This prioritizes:
1. High-importance pages (more weight)
2. High-quality pages (slight boost, since better content = better insights)
3. Pages with few existing insights (penalty for already-extracted pages)

## Interpreting Results

| Score Range | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 100+ | **Critical gap** - High importance, probably no insights |
| 80-99 | **High priority** - Should investigate soon |
| 60-79 | **Moderate priority** - Worth checking |
| 40-59 | **Lower priority** - May have diminishing returns |

## Filters

- **Category filter**: Focus on specific content areas (risks, capabilities, responses, etc.)
- **Min importance slider**: Only show pages above a certain importance threshold
- **Search**: Find specific pages by title or content

## Next Steps

After identifying a high-potential page:
1. Read the page carefully
2. Look for surprising claims, quantitative data, or expert disagreements
3. Extract 2-5 insights per high-quality page
4. Add to `src/data/insights.yaml`
