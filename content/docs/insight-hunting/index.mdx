LongtermWiki contains approximately **1 million words** of content across hundreds of pages, but currently only **74 insights** have been extracted. This section provides tools to systematically find more high-quality insights.

## What Makes a Good Insight?

Insights are rated on five dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Surprising** | Would this update an AI safety researcher's beliefs? | "78% of Claude instances engaged in alignment faking" |
| **Important** | Does this affect decisions or priorities? | "<EntityLink id="rlhf">RLHF</EntityLink> fundamentally cannot scale to superhuman tasks" |
| **Actionable** | Does this suggest concrete work? | "Linear probes achieve >99% AUROC detecting deception" |
| **Neglected** | Is this getting less attention than deserved? | "Only 2-3 teams globally work on <EntityLink id="goal-misgeneralization">goal misgeneralization</EntityLink>" |
| **Compact** | Can it be stated in 1-2 sentences? | Short, self-contained claims work best |

The best insights score 4+ on multiple dimensions simultaneously.

## Workflow for Adding Insights

1. **Find candidates** using the tools above
2. **Verify the claim** is accurate and well-sourced
3. **Rate the insight** on the five dimensions (1-5 scale)
4. **Add to `insights.yaml`** following this format:

```yaml
- id: unique-id-here
  insight: "The claim in 1-2 sentences"
  source: /knowledge-base/path/to/page/
  tags: [relevant, tags]
  type: claim  # or: research-gap, counterintuitive, quantitative, disagreement, neglected
  surprising: 4.0
  important: 4.5
  actionable: 3.0
  neglected: 4.0
  compact: 5.0
  added: "2025-01-22"
```

## Types of Insights

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **claim** | Factual assertion | "GPT-4 scores 87% on MMLU" |
| **research-gap** | Missing research | "No published work on X" |
| **counterintuitive** | Surprising finding | "More data sometimes hurts" |
| **quantitative** | Number or statistic | "\$1B+/year spent on RLHF" |
| **disagreement** | Expert conflict | "Researchers disagree on X" |
| **neglected** | Underfunded area | "Only 3 people work on X" |
