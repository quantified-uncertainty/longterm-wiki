## How It Works

The Table Candidates tool scans structured data tables for rows with "paradoxical" or notable rating combinations that suggest insight-worthy content.

### Safety Approaches Criteria

Rows are flagged when they have:

| Criterion | Why It's Interesting |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Capability-dominant differential progress** | Safety research that primarily advances capabilities is surprising |
| **Weak/no deception robustness** | Reveals fundamental limitations of popular approaches |
| **PRIORITIZE recommendation** | Identifies underfunded high-value research |
| **DEFUND/REDUCE recommendation** | Challenges conventional wisdom on research priorities |
| **Unclear/harmful net safety** | Questions whether "safety" work actually makes things safer |
| **Doesn't scale to superintelligence** | Important limitation for long-term planning |

### Accident Risks Criteria

Rows are flagged when they have:

| Criterion | Why It's Interesting |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Catastrophic/existential severity + hard to detect** | Worst-case scenarios we can't easily monitor |
| **Lab-demonstrated + severe** | Empirical evidence of serious risks |
| **Current timeline + severe** | Not hypothetical - happening now |

## Using the Tool

1. **Browse candidates** sorted by source (Safety Approaches, Accident Risks)
2. **Review matched criteria** to understand why each row was flagged
3. **Check key ratings** for the full context
4. **Copy the insight template** as a starting point
5. **Refine and verify** before adding to insights.yaml

## Example Insights from Tables

From Safety Approaches table:
> "<EntityLink id="rlhf">RLHF</EntityLink> provides primarily capability uplift (DOMINANT) with limited safety benefit (LOW-MEDIUM), and fundamentally cannot scale to superhuman tasks where humans can't evaluate outputs."

From Accident Risks table:
> "<EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment">Deceptive alignment</EntityLink> represents an existential risk that is very difficult to detect. 78% alignment faking rate observed in <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>'s 2024 study."
