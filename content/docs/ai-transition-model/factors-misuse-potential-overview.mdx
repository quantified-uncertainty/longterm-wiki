<DataInfoBox entityId="E207" />

Misuse Potential measures the likelihood and severity of AI being weaponized or exploited by malicious actors. Unlike <EntityLink id="factors-misalignment-potential-overview">Misalignment Potential</EntityLink> (which measures unintended AI behavior), Misuse Potential measures intentional harmful use by humans.

**Primary outcome affected:** <EntityLink id="existential-catastrophe">Existential Catastrophe</EntityLink> ↑↑↑

High misuse potential means more vectors for catastrophe even if AI systems are well-aligned. These threats can overwhelm defenses, trigger cascading failures, or exploit concentrated power.

## Internal Dynamics

These threats compound each other:

- **Concentration amplifies impact**: When control is concentrated, single failures affect everyone
- **Bio and cyber interact**: Same AI capabilities that enable one often enable the other
- **Threat success breeds threat**: Successful attacks demonstrate viability and attract more actors

This creates **threat escalation dynamics**—each incident makes the next more likely.

## Relationship to Misalignment Potential

Misuse Potential and <EntityLink id="factors-misalignment-potential-overview">Misalignment Potential</EntityLink> are complementary risk factors:

| Factor | Misalignment Potential | Misuse Potential |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| Source | AI behavior | Human actors |
| Direction | AI pursues unintended goals | Humans weaponize AI |
| Focus | Technical alignment | Access controls & defense |
| Improvability | Research & investment | Harder to reduce |

**Both matter**: Either can cause existential catastrophe independently. High misalignment potential means AI might cause harm on its own; high misuse potential means humans will use AI to cause harm.

## Why Concentration Matters

<EntityLink id="ai-control-concentration">AI Control Concentration</EntityLink> is unique because its effect **depends on who controls**:
- If control concentrates in **safety-conscious actors**: May reduce risk
- If control concentrates in **reckless or malicious actors**: Dramatically increases risk
- In either case: **Reduces resilience** to bad actors gaining control

This makes concentration a key uncertainty in existential catastrophe assessment.
