Long-term Lock-in refers to scenarios where AI enables the permanent entrenchment of certain conditions - whether values, power structures, or epistemic environments. Unlike acute catastrophes, <EntityLink id="lock-in">lock-in</EntityLink> may unfold gradually and may not be immediately recognized as harmful.

## Variants

<FactorSubItemsList factorId="long-term-lockin" client:load />

## Key Root Factors

<FactorRelationshipDiagram nodeId="long-term-lockin" direction="incoming" client:load />

### Model Estimates

<ImpactList nodeId="long-term-lockin" direction="to" compact={true} client:load />

## Dual Nature

Unlike other scenarios, lock-in is not inherently negative:

| Pole | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Positive** | Beneficial values and institutions stabilized, protected from degradation |
| **Negative** | Authoritarian control, harmful ideologies, or stagnation permanently entrenched |

## Outcomes

Long-term Lock-in primarily affects:
- **<EntityLink id="long-term-trajectory">Long-term Trajectory</EntityLink>**: The quality and character of the post-transition future
- May contribute to **<EntityLink id="existential-catastrophe">Existential Catastrophe</EntityLink>** if lock-in prevents course correction
