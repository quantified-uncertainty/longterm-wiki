AI Ownership refers to who controls the most powerful AI systems and their outputs. Concentration among a few companies, countries, or individuals creates different risks than broad distribution. Ownership structure shapes incentives, accountability, and the distribution of AI benefits.

## Relationship to Scenarios

AI Ownership primarily affects **Long-term <EntityLink id="E189">Lock-in</EntityLink>** scenarios:

- Concentrated ownership shapes what values and power structures get entrenched
- Ownership patterns determine accountability and reversibility
- Distribution of AI benefits affects social stability

Also affects:
- **<EntityLink id="E670">AI Takeover</EntityLink>**: Concentrated ownership could help or hurt depending on the actor
- **<EntityLink id="E671">Human-Caused Catastrophe</EntityLink>**: Depends on who controls AI and their intentions

## Key Debates

| Debate | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Concentration effects | Is AI lab concentration good (easier to regulate) or bad (single points of failure)? |
| Profit vs safety | Can profit-motivated companies be trusted with AI safety? |
| Open source role | Does open source AI democratize capability or make dangerous systems accessible? |
| US-China dynamics | Is competition inevitable, or can cooperation emerge? |
