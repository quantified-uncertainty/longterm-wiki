Root Factors are the top-level causal drivers that shape AI transition outcomes. They bridge the gap between specific [component parameters](#) and <EntityLink id="outcomes-overview">ultimate outcomes</EntityLink> like <EntityLink id="existential-catastrophe">existential catastrophe</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="long-term-trajectory">long-term trajectory</EntityLink>.

See the <EntityLink id="ai-transition-model">interactive AI transition model</EntityLink> for a visual representation.
