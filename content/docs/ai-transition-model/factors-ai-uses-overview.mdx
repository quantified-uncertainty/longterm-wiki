<DataInfoBox entityId="E17" />

AI Uses refers to where and how AI is actually deployed in the economy and society. Key applications include recursive AI development (AI improving AI), integration into critical industries, government use for surveillance or military, and tools for coordination and decision-making.

**For interactive exploration of how AI Uses relates to other factors, see the [AI Transition Model Graph](/ai-transition-model/graph/).**

## Key Dimensions

<FactorSubItemsList factorId="ai-uses" />

## Relationship to Scenarios

AI Uses primarily affects **Long-term <EntityLink id="lock-in">Lock-in</EntityLink>** scenarios:

- Where AI is deployed determines what structures get entrenched
- <EntityLink id="recursive-ai-capabilities">Recursive AI capabilities</EntityLink> could accelerate all scenarios
- Government use shapes surveillance and control possibilities

Also affects:
- **<EntityLink id="scenarios-ai-takeover-overview">AI Takeover</EntityLink>**: Recursive AI and broad deployment increase takeover paths
- **<EntityLink id="scenarios-human-catastrophe-overview">Human-Caused Catastrophe</EntityLink>**: Some uses increase risk, others enable better coordination

## Key Debates

| Debate | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Takeoff speed | Will AI self-improvement be gradual (months/years) or sudden (days/weeks)? |
| Human bottlenecks | Do human researchers bottleneck recursive improvement, or can AI overcome these? |
| Critical infrastructure | How much AI in critical systems is too much? |
| Reversibility | Once AI is deeply integrated, can we remove it if problems emerge? |
