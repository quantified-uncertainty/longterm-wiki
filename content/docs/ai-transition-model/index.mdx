The AI Transition Model is a causal framework for understanding how various factors influence the trajectory of AI development and its ultimate outcomes for humanity. The interactive diagram above shows how **Root Factors** flow through **Ultimate Scenarios** to determine **Ultimate Outcomes**.

This model helps identify:
1. **Leverage points**: Which factors have the most influence on outcomes
2. **Intervention targets**: Where effort can most effectively shift trajectories
3. **Key uncertainties**: Which causal relationships are most uncertain
4. **Scenario dependencies**: How different pathways interact

## How Parameters, Risks, and Interventions Connect

Both **risks** and **interventions** connect to root factors:
- **Risks** (like <EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment">deceptive alignment</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="racing-dynamics">racing dynamics</EntityLink>) tend to *increase* harmful factors or *decrease* protective ones
- **Interventions** (like interpretability research, compute governance) work to counteract risks

**Interactive Views:**
- **<EntityLink id="table">Parameter Table</EntityLink>** - Sortable tables with ratings (changeability, uncertainty, x-risk impact, trajectory)
- **Graph View** - Visual causal diagram showing relationships between factors, scenarios, and outcomes

## Why This Framing Matters

### Traditional Risk Framing
- "Trust erosion is a risk we must prevent"
- "<EntityLink id="concentration-of-power">Concentration of power</EntityLink> threatens democracy"
- Focus: Avoiding negative outcomes

### Parameter Framing
- "Trust is a parameter that AI affects in both directions"
- "Power distribution is a variable we can influence through policy"
- Focus: Understanding dynamics and identifying intervention points

The parameter framing enables:

1. **Better modeling**: Can estimate current levels, trends, and intervention effects
2. **Clearer priorities**: Which parameters matter most for good outcomes?
3. **Strategic allocation**: Where should resources go to maintain critical parameters?
4. **Progress tracking**: Are our interventions actually improving parameter levels?

## Relationship to Other Sections

| Section | Relationship to Parameters |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Risks** | Many risks describe *decreases* in parameters (e.g., "trust erosion" = trust declining) |
| **Interventions** | Interventions aim to *increase* or *stabilize* parameters |
| **Metrics** | Metrics are *concrete measurements* of parameter levels |
| **Models** | Analytical models often estimate parameter dynamics and trajectories |

## How to Use This Section

### For Researchers
- Understand which underlying variables matter for AI outcomes
- Identify gaps between current and optimal parameter levels
- Design studies to measure parameter changes

### For Policymakers
- Prioritize interventions based on which parameters are most degraded
- Monitor parameter trends to assess policy effectiveness
- Coordinate across domains (a single parameter may affect multiple risks)

### For Forecasters
- Use parameters as input variables for scenario modeling
- Estimate how different interventions would shift parameter levels
- Identify tipping points where parameter degradation becomes irreversible
