llmSummary: "This is a high-level index/overview page for AI capabilities as a root factor in an AI Transition Model, cataloging dimensions like reasoning, coding, and agentic AI with brief status labels and linking to scenario types (takeover, misuse). It provides no original analysis, quantification, or actionable guidance—functioning primarily as a navigation hub with thin descriptive content."

AI Capabilities refers to how powerful AI systems become across multiple dimensions. This is a key root factor in the AI Transition Model because capability levels directly influence the probability and severity of various scenarios.

**For detailed tracking of current AI capabilities, see the Capabilities section.**

## Capability Categories

The Knowledge Base tracks capabilities across several domains:

| Capability | Status | Risk Relevance |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| <EntityLink id="language-models">Language Models</EntityLink> | Rapidly advancing | Foundation for all other capabilities |
| <EntityLink id="reasoning">Reasoning</EntityLink> | Emerging | Key for general intelligence |
| <EntityLink id="coding">Coding</EntityLink> | Human-competitive | Enables self-improvement |
| <EntityLink id="agentic-ai">Agentic AI</EntityLink> | Early stage | Enables autonomous action |
| <EntityLink id="tool-use">Tool Use</EntityLink> | Growing | Expands action space |
| <EntityLink id="scientific-research">Scientific Research</EntityLink> | Emerging | Could accelerate capability growth |
| <EntityLink id="situational-awareness">Situational Awareness</EntityLink> | Emerging | Key prerequisite for <EntityLink id="scheming">scheming</EntityLink> |
| <EntityLink id="self-improvement">Self-improvement</EntityLink> | Theoretical | Could lead to recursive improvement |
| <EntityLink id="persuasion">Persuasion</EntityLink> | Concerning | Enables manipulation at scale |
| <EntityLink id="long-horizon">Long-horizon Tasks</EntityLink> | Early stage | Enables complex autonomous projects |

## Relationship to Scenarios

Higher AI capabilities primarily increase the probability and severity of **AI Takeover** scenarios:

- **<EntityLink id="rapid">Rapid Takeover</EntityLink>**: Requires sufficient capability for decisive action
- **<EntityLink id="gradual">Gradual Takeover</EntityLink>**: Enabled by increasing autonomy and generality over time

Capabilities also affect <EntityLink id="scenarios-human-catastrophe-overview">Human-Caused Catastrophe</EntityLink> scenarios by enabling more powerful <EntityLink id="bioweapons">Bioweapons</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="cyberweapons">Cyberweapons</EntityLink>, and <EntityLink id="autonomous-weapons">Autonomous Weapons</EntityLink>.

## Current Trajectory

AI capabilities are advancing rapidly across all dimensions, driven by:
- Scaling laws (more compute, data, parameters)
- Algorithmic improvements (transformers, <EntityLink id="rlhf">RLHF</EntityLink>, reasoning chains)
- Hardware advances (specialized AI chips, larger clusters)
- Increased investment (≈\$100B+ annually in US alone)

**Key metrics** are tracked at [Epoch AI](https://epochai.org/) and [Stanford HAI AI Index](https://aiindex.stanford.edu/).
