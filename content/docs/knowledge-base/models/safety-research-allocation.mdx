## Overview

AI safety research allocation determines which existential risks get addressed and which remain neglected. With approximately \$100M annually flowing into safety research across sectors, resource distribution shapes everything from alignment research priorities to governance capacity.

Current allocation shows stark imbalances: industry controls 60-70% of resources while academia receives only 15-20%, creating systematic gaps in independent research. <R id="898065a672b179c6">Expert analysis</R> suggests this distribution leads to 30-50% efficiency losses compared to optimal allocation, with critical areas like <EntityLink id="multi-agent">multi-agent safety</EntityLink> receiving 3-5x less attention than warranted by their risk contribution.

The model reveals three key findings: (1) talent concentration in 5-10 organizations creates dangerous dependencies, (2) commercial incentives systematically underfund long-term theoretical work, and (3) government capacity building lags 5-10 years behind need.

## Resource Distribution Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Severity | Likelihood | Timeline | Trend |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|-------|
| Industry capture of safety agenda | High | 80% | Current | Worsening |
| Academic brain drain acceleration | High | 90% | 2-5 years | Worsening |
| Neglected area funding gaps | Very High | 95% | Current | Stable |
| Government capacity shortfall | Medium | 70% | 3-7 years | Improving slowly |

## Intervention Strategies

### Academic Strengthening

| Intervention | Cost | Impact | Timeline |
|-------------|------|--------|---------|
| **Endowed Chairs** | \$100M total | 20 permanent positions | 3-5 years |
| **Compute Infrastructure** | \$50M annually | 5x academic capability | 1-2 years |
| **Salary Competitiveness** | \$200M annually | 50% retention increase | Immediate |
| **Model Access Programs** | \$20M annually | Research quality boost | 1 year |

### Government Capacity Building

**Technical Hiring:**
- Special authority for AI researchers
- Competitive pay scales (GS-15+ equivalent)
- Streamlined security clearance process
- Industry rotation programs

**Research Infrastructure:**
- National AI testbed facilities
- Shared evaluation frameworks
- Interagency coordination mechanisms
- International partnership protocols

### Industry Accountability

**Research Independence:**
- Protected safety research budgets (10% of R&D)
- Publication requirements for safety findings
- External advisory board oversight
- Whistleblower protections

**Resource Sharing:**
- Academic model access programs
- Compute donation requirements
- Graduate student fellowship funding
- Open-source safety tooling

### Critical Research Questions

1. **Independence vs. Access Tradeoff:** Can academic research remain relevant without frontier model access? If labs control cutting-edge systems, academic safety research may become increasingly disconnected from actual risks.

2. **Government Technical Capacity:** Can government agencies develop sufficient expertise fast enough? Current hiring practices and salary constraints may make this structurally impossible.

3. **Open vs. Closed Research:** Should safety findings be published openly? Transparency accelerates good safety work but may also accelerate dangerous capabilities.

4. **Coordination Mechanisms:** Who should set global safety research priorities? Decentralized approaches may be inefficient; centralized approaches may be wrong or captured.

### Empirical Cruxes

**Talent Elasticity:**
- How responsive is safety researcher supply to funding?
- Can academic career paths compete with industry?
- What retention strategies actually work?

**Research Quality:**
- How much does model access matter for safety research?
- Can theoretical work proceed without empirical validation?
- Which research approaches transfer across systems?

**Timeline Pressures:**
- How long to build effective government capacity?
- When do current allocation patterns lock in?
- Can coordination mechanisms scale with field growth?
