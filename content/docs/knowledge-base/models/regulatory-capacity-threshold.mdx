## Overview

Effective AI regulation requires regulatory bodies to possess sufficient technical understanding, legal authority, and operational capacity to credibly oversee an industry advancing rapidly. This model quantifies the minimum threshold of **regulatory-capacity** relative to industry capability needed for meaningful oversight.

**Core insight:** <EntityLink id="regulatory-capacity">Regulatory capacity</EntityLink> is currently 0.15-0.25 of the threshold needed for credible oversight. The gap is widening as industry capability grows faster than regulatory capacity. There exists a window of approximately 3-5 years to build adequate capacity before the gap becomes prohibitively difficult to close.

The critical question is not whether to regulate AI, but whether regulatory capacity can scale fast enough to remain relevant.

## Conceptual Framework

### Capacity Components

Regulatory capacity ($C$) decomposes into three multiplicative factors:

$$
C = H \times A \times S
$$

Where:
- $H$ = Human capital (technical expertise, staffing levels)
- $A$ = Authority (legal powers, enforcement mechanisms)
- $S$ = Scope (jurisdictional coverage, <EntityLink id="international-coordination">international coordination</EntityLink>)

Each factor is necessary but not sufficient. Weak links constrain overall capacity.

### Threshold Definition

The **regulatory capacity threshold** ($T$) is the minimum capacity needed for credible oversight, defined as:

$$
T = f(\text{Industry Capability}, \text{Risk Level}, \text{Oversight Ambition})
$$

Credible oversight means regulators can:
1. **Evaluate** lab safety claims independently
2. **Detect** non-compliance in reasonable timeframes
3. **Enforce** requirements with meaningful consequences
4. **Adapt** standards as capabilities evolve

## Current State Assessment

### Capacity by Jurisdiction

| Jurisdiction | Human Capital | Authority | Scope | Overall Capacity | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|-------|------------------|-------|
| **US (AISI)** | 0.2 | 0.15 | 0.3 | 0.15-0.20 | No regulatory authority, advisory only |
| **UK (AISI)** | 0.25 | 0.2 | 0.25 | 0.18-0.22 | Stronger evals team, limited legal powers |
| **EU** | 0.15 | 0.4 | 0.35 | 0.15-0.25 | Legal framework exists, implementation weak |
| **China** | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.20-0.30 | Strong domestic authority, no international scope |
| **Combined Global** | 0.25 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.18-0.25 | Fragmentation reduces effective capacity |

### Capacity vs. Threshold Gap

| Dimension | Current Level | Threshold Needed | Gap |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-----|
| Technical staff (FTEs with ML expertise) | ≈100-200 globally | ≈500-1000 | 3-5x |
| Evaluation capability (models assessable/year) | ≈5-10 | ≈20-50 | 3-5x |
| Enforcement actions (credible threat) | Near zero | Demonstrated | Qualitative |
| International coordination | Ad hoc | Treaty-based | Structural |
| Response time to incidents | Months | Days-weeks | 10x |

<Aside type="caution">
**The gap is widening.** Industry capability is growing 2-3x per year while regulatory capacity grows 10-30% per year. Without intervention, the capacity ratio will fall below 0.1 within 3-5 years.
</Aside>

## Core Model

### Capacity Ratio Dynamics

Define the capacity ratio $R$:

$$
R(t) = \frac{C(t)}{I(t)}
$$

Where $C(t)$ is regulatory capacity and $I(t)$ is industry capability at time $t$.

The dynamics follow:

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = R \cdot (g_C - g_I)
$$

Where $g_C$ is capacity growth rate and $g_I$ is industry capability growth rate.

### Parameter Estimates

| Parameter | Current Estimate | Range | Source |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| $g_C$ (capacity growth) | 15% per year | 10-30% | AISI staffing trends |
| $g_I$ (industry growth) | 100-200% per year | 50-300% | Scaling law projections |
| $R_0$ (current ratio) | 0.20 | 0.15-0.25 | Assessment above |
| $T$ (threshold ratio) | 0.50 | 0.40-0.60 | Based on historical analogs |

### Trajectory Projections

| Year | Industry Capability Index | Regulatory Capacity Index | Ratio | Status |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------|--------|
| 2025 | 1.0 | 0.20 | 0.20 | Below threshold |
| 2026 | 2.5 | 0.25 | 0.10 | Declining |
| 2027 | 6.0 | 0.30 | 0.05 | Critical gap |
| 2028 | 15.0 | 0.36 | 0.02 | Effective irrelevance |

## Intervention Analysis

### Capacity Building Levers

| Lever | Effect on $g_C$ | Feasibility | Timeline | Key Barriers |
|-------|----------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Increase AISI staffing 3x | +50% to $g_C$ | Medium | 2-3 years | Talent competition, budget |
| Grant regulatory authority | +30% effectiveness | Low-Medium | 2-5 years | Political will |
| International coordination | +40% scope | Low | 3-10 years | Geopolitics |
| Private sector secondments | +20% expertise | Medium-High | 1-2 years | Conflicts of interest |
| Academic partnerships | +15% research capacity | High | 1-3 years | Publication incentives |

### Threshold Modification

Alternatively, reduce the threshold needed:

| Approach | Effect on $T$ | Feasibility | Tradeoff |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Lab self-regulation | -20% threshold | Medium | Lower accountability |
| Third-party auditing | -15% threshold | Medium-High | Quality variance |
| Automated monitoring | -25% threshold | Medium | Technical limitations |
| Narrow scope (frontier only) | -30% threshold | High | Coverage gaps |

### Combined Scenario

With aggressive intervention:

| Intervention Package | $g_C$ Increase | $T$ Decrease | 2030 Ratio |
|---------------------|----------------|--------------|------------|
| Baseline | 0% | 0% | 0.01 |
| Moderate investment | +30% | -15% | 0.12 |
| Aggressive investment | +80% | -25% | 0.35 |
| Crisis response + coordination | +150% | -30% | 0.55 |

<Aside type="tip" title="Bottom Line">
**Crossing the threshold requires crisis-level investment.** Moderate increases in regulatory capacity will not close the gap. Either (a) major incident triggers emergency capacity building, or (b) proactive "wartime-like" investment begins within 1-2 years.
</Aside>

## Historical Analogies

### Regulatory Capacity in Other Domains

| Domain | Initial Gap | Time to Threshold | Key Driver |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Nuclear (NRC)** | Large | 10-15 years | Manhattan Project expertise transfer |
| **Aviation (FAA)** | Moderate | 20-30 years | Gradual accident-driven expansion |
| **Finance (SEC/Fed)** | Large | 20-40 years | Major crises (1929, 2008) |
| **Pharma (FDA)** | Moderate | 15-25 years | Thalidomide + consumer pressure |
| **AI (current)** | Very large | ? | TBD |

**Lesson:** Capacity building typically takes 10-30 years without major crises. AI timelines may not allow this luxury.

### Failure Modes

| Failure Mode | Historical Example | AI Analog |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Capture | FAA-Boeing relationship | Lab-AISI personnel flows |
| Underfunding | Pre-2008 SEC derivatives | Current AISI budget |
| Jurisdictional gaps | Offshore finance | Compute arbitrage |
| Technical lag | Crypto regulation | ML capability evaluation |

## Strategic Implications

### Priority Actions by Actor

**For policymakers:**

| Action | Priority | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Triple AISI budget | High | Necessary but not sufficient |
| Grant enforcement authority | Critical | Without this, capacity is advisory only |
| Establish international coordination | High | Prevents arbitrage |
| Create fast-track hiring | Medium | Reduce talent acquisition friction |

**For funders:**

| Action | Priority | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Fund independent technical capacity | High | Supplements government capacity |
| Support regulatory career pipelines | Medium | Long-term capacity building |
| Back third-party audit infrastructure | High | Reduces threshold |

**For labs:**

| Action | Priority | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Enable regulator access | Medium | Reduces information asymmetry |
| Provide secondments | Medium | Builds mutual understanding |
| Support regulatory authority | High | Self-interest in level playing field |

### Window Analysis

The **window for effective intervention** depends on:

| Factor | Status | Implication |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Capability timeline | 2-5 years to transformative AI | Urgency is high |
| Political will | Low but rising | Incident may be required |
| Talent availability | Constrained | Salary competition fierce |
| International coordination | Weak | Unilateral action may be necessary |

**Window estimate:** 3-5 years before the capacity gap becomes practically irreversible for traditional regulatory approaches.

## Limitations

1. **Capability measurement:** "Industry capability" is hard to quantify; proxies like compute or benchmark performance are imperfect.

2. **Threshold uncertainty:** The 0.4-0.6 threshold is extrapolated from other domains; AI may require higher or lower ratios.

3. **Non-linear dynamics:** Step-function changes in capability (e.g., recursive self-improvement) would invalidate gradual growth assumptions.

4. **Political economy:** Model assumes regulators act in public interest; capture dynamics may reduce effective capacity.

5. **Alternative governance:** Non-regulatory mechanisms (insurance, liability, standards) may substitute for government capacity.
