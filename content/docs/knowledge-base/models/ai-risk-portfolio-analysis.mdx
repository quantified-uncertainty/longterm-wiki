## Overview

This framework provides quantitative estimates for allocating limited resources across AI risk categories. Based on expert surveys and risk assessment methodologies from organizations like <R id="0a17f30e99091ebf">RAND</R> and <R id="f0d95954b449240a"><EntityLink id="cset">Center for Security and Emerging Technology</EntityLink> (CSET)</R>, the analysis estimates misalignment accounts for 40-70% of existential risk, misuse 15-35%, and structural risks 10-25%.

The model draws from <R id="d199149badb220f3">portfolio optimization theory</R> and <R id="d64c91adf6a2e394"><EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving's</EntityLink> cause prioritization framework</R>, addressing the critical question: How should the AI safety community allocate its \$100M+ annual resources across different risk categories? All estimates carry substantial uncertainty (±50% or higher), making the framework's value in relative comparisons rather than precise numbers.

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category | X-Risk Share | P(Catastrophe) | Tractability | Neglectedness | Current Allocation |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Misalignment | 40-70% | 15-45% | 2.5/5 | 3/5 | ≈50% |
| Misuse | 15-35% | 8-25% | 3.5/5 | 4/5 | ≈25% |
| Structural | 10-25% | 5-15% | 4/5 | 4.5/5 | ≈15% |
| Accidents (non-X) | 5-15% | 20-40% | 4.5/5 | 2.5/5 | ≈10% |

<Aside type="caution" title="Uncertainty Bounds">
These estimates represent informed speculation based on limited data. <R id="ad946fbdfec12e8c">Superforecasters</R> and <R id="38eba87d0a888e2e">AI experts show significant disagreement</R> on these parameters, with confidence intervals often spanning 2-3x.
</Aside>

## Strategic Prioritization Framework

### Expected Value Calculation

The framework applies standard expected value methodology:

$$
\text{Priority Score} = \text{Risk Magnitude} \times \text{P(Success)} \times \text{Neglectedness Multiplier}
$$

| Category | Risk Magnitude | P(Success) | Neglectedness | Priority Score |
|----------|----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Misalignment | 8.5/10 | 0.25 | 0.6 | 1.28 |
| Misuse | 6.0/10 | 0.35 | 0.8 | 1.68 |
| Structural | 4.5/10 | 0.40 | 0.9 | 1.62 |

### Timeline-Dependent Allocation

Resource allocation should vary significantly based on <EntityLink id="agi-timeline">AGI timeline beliefs</EntityLink>:

| Timeline Scenario | Misalignment | Misuse | Structural | Rationale |
|------------------|--------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Short (2-5 years) | 70-80% | 15-20% | 5-10% | Only time for direct alignment work |
| Medium (5-15 years) | 50-60% | 25-30% | 15-20% | Balanced portfolio approach |
| Long (15+ years) | 40-50% | 20-25% | 25-30% | Time for institutional solutions |

<Mermaid chart={`

### Funding Landscape Analysis

Based on comprehensive analysis from <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink>, [Longview Philanthropy estimates](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XdhwXppfqrpPL2YDX/an-overview-of-the-ai-safety-funding-situation), and [LTFF reporting](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pJyCWzevPHsycj4oQ/long-term-future-fund-may-2023-to-march-2024-payout), external AI safety funding reached approximately \$110-130M in 2024:

| Funding Source | 2024 Amount | Share | Key Focus Areas |
|----------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> | \$63.6M | ≈49% | Technical alignment, evaluations, governance |
| Survival & Flourishing Fund | \$19M+ | ≈15% | Diverse safety research |
| Long-Term Future Fund | \$5.4M | ≈4% | Early-career, small orgs |
| Jaan Tallinn & individual donors | \$20M | ≈15% | Direct grants to researchers |
| Government (US/UK/EU) | \$32.4M | ≈25% | Policy-aligned research |
| Other (foundations, corporate) | \$10-20M | ≈10% | Various |

The breakdown by research area reveals significant concentration in interpretability and evaluations:

| Research Area | 2024 Funding | Share | Trend | Optimal (Medium Timeline) |
|---------------|--------------|-------|-------|---------------------------|
| Interpretability | \$52M | 40% | Growing | 30-35% |
| Evaluations/benchmarking | \$23M | 18% | Rapid growth | 15-20% |
| Constitutional AI/RLHF | \$38M | 29% | Stable | 25-30% |
| Governance/policy | \$18M | 14% | Underfunded | 20-25% |
| Red-teaming | \$15M | 12% | Growing | 10-15% |
| Agent safety | \$8.2M | 6% | Emerging | 10-15% |

<Aside type="note" title="Coefficient Giving Dominance">
<EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> accounts for nearly 60% of all external AI safety investment, with \$63.6M deployed in 2024. Since 2017, Coefficient Giving has donated approximately \$336M to AI safety (~12% of their total \$2.8B in giving). The median Coefficient Giving AI safety grant is \$257k; the average is \$1.67M.

### Correlation Matrix

| Risk Pair | Correlation | Implication for Portfolio |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Misalignment ↔ Capabilities | +0.8 | High correlation; capabilities research affects risk |
| Misuse ↔ Governance Quality | -0.6 | Good governance significantly reduces misuse |
| Structural ↔ All Others | +0.4 | Structural risks amplify other categories |

## Comparative Assessment Methods

### Expert Survey Results

Multiple surveys reveal substantial disagreement on AI risk magnitude. <R id="38eba87d0a888e2e">AI Impacts 2022 expert survey</R> of 738 AI researchers and the [Conjecture internal survey](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kygEPBDrGGoM8rz9a/conjecture-internal-survey-agi-timelines-and-probability-of) provide contrasting perspectives:

| Risk Category | AI Impacts Median | Conjecture Median | Expert Disagreement (IQR) | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------|
| Total AI X-risk | 5-10% | 80% | 2-90% | Massive disagreement |
| Misalignment-specific | 25% | 60%+ | 10-50% | Safety org workers higher |
| Misuse (Bio/weapons) | 15% | 30-40% | 5-35% | Growing concern |
| Economic Disruption | 35% | 50%+ | 20-60% | Most consensus |
| Authoritarian Control | 20% | 40% | 8-45% | Underexplored |

<Aside type="tip" title="Interpreting Survey Disagreement">
The [Conjecture survey](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/kygEPBDrGGoM8rz9a/conjecture-internal-survey-agi-timelines-and-probability-of) (N=22 AI safety researchers) found no respondent reported less than 10% extinction risk, with a median of 80%. However, this sample has severe selection bias—AI safety researchers self-select for high risk estimates. The [AI Impacts survey](https://aiimpacts.org/) sampled mainstream ML researchers with lower risk estimates but suffered from non-response bias. True uncertainty likely spans 2-50% for catastrophic outcomes.
</Aside>

### Case Study Comparisons

Historical technology risk portfolios provide calibration:

| Technology | Primary Risk Focus | Secondary Risks | Outcome Assessment |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Nuclear weapons | Accident prevention (60%) | Proliferation (40%) | Reasonable allocation |
| Climate change | Mitigation (70%) | Adaptation (30%) | Under-weighted adaptation |
| Internet security | Technical fixes (80%) | Governance (20%) | Under-weighted governance |

Pattern: **Technical communities systematically under-weight governance and structural interventions**.

## Uncertainty Analysis

### Key Cruxes Affecting Allocation

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "What's the probability of transformative AI by 2030? (affects all allocations)",
    "How tractable is technical alignment with current approaches?",
    "Does AI lower bioweapons barriers by 10x or 1000x?",
    "Are structural risks primarily instrumental or terminal concerns?",
    "What's the correlation between AI capability and alignment difficulty?"
  ]}
/>

### Sensitivity Analysis

| Parameter Change | Effect on Misalignment Priority | Effect on Misuse Priority |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Timeline -50% (shorter) | +15-20 percentage points | -5-10 percentage points |
| Alignment tractability +50% | -10-15 percentage points | +5-8 percentage points |
| Bioweapons risk +100% | -5-8 percentage points | +10-15 percentage points |
| Governance effectiveness +50% | -3-5 percentage points | +8-12 percentage points |

## Geographic Distribution of Funding

The AI safety funding landscape shows significant geographic concentration, with implications for portfolio diversification:

| Region | 2024 Funding | Share | Key Organizations | Gap Assessment |
|--------|--------------|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| SF Bay Area | \$48M | 37% | CHAI, MIRI, Anthropic | Well-funded |
| London/Oxford | \$32M | 25% | FHI, DeepMind, GovAI | Well-funded |
| Boston/Cambridge | \$12M | 9% | MIT, Harvard | Growing |
| Washington DC | \$8M | 6% | CSET, CNAS, Brookings | Policy focus |
| Rest of US | \$10M | 8% | Academic dispersed | Moderate |
| Europe (non-UK) | \$8M | 6% | Berlin, Zurich hubs | Underfunded |
| Asia-Pacific | \$4M | 3% | Singapore, Australia | Severely underfunded |
| Rest of World | \$8M | 6% | Various | Very limited |

<Aside type="note" title="Emerging Hubs">
Government initiatives are expanding geographic coverage: Canada's \$12M AI Safety Research Initiative, Australia's \$8.4M Responsible AI Program, and Singapore's \$5.6M AI Ethics Research Fund launched in 2024-2025. These represent opportunities for funding diversification beyond the US/UK axis.

## Current State and Trajectory

### 2024 Funding Landscape

Based on [detailed analysis](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WGpFFJo2uFe5ssgEb/an-overview-of-the-ai-safety-funding-situation) and <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> grant data, external AI safety funding has evolved significantly:

| Year | External Funding | Internal Lab Safety | Total (Est.) | Key Developments |
|------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|
| 2020 | \$40-60M | \$50-100M | \$100-160M | Coefficient Giving ramping up |
| 2021 | \$60-80M | \$100-200M | \$160-280M | Anthropic founded |
| 2022 | \$80-100M | \$200-400M | \$280-500M | ChatGPT launch |
| 2023 | \$90-120M | \$400-600M | \$490-720M | Major lab investment |
| 2024 | \$110-130M | \$500-700M | \$610-830M | Government entry |

<Aside type="caution" title="Internal vs External Funding">
Major AI labs—Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind—invest an estimated \$500M+ combined in internal safety research annually, dwarfing external philanthropic funding. However, internal research may face conflicts of interest with commercial objectives, making external independent funding particularly valuable for governance and red-teaming work.
</Aside>

### Coefficient Giving Technical AI Safety Grants (2024)

[Detailed analysis](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/adzfKEW98TswZEA6T/brief-analysis-of-op-technical-ai-safety-funding) of <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving's</EntityLink> \$28M in Technical AI Safety grants reveals:

| Focus Area | Share of CG TAIS | Key Recipients | Assessment |
|------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Evaluations/benchmarking | 68% | METR, Apollo, UK AISI | Heavily funded |
| Interpretability | 12% | Anthropic, Redwood | Well-funded |
| Robustness | 8% | Academic groups | Moderate |
| Value alignment | 5% | MIRI, academic | Underfunded |
| Field building | 5% | MATS, training programs | Adequate |
| Other approaches | 2% | Various | Exploratory |

### Projected 2025-2027 Needs

| Scenario | Annual Need | Technical | Governance | Field Building | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Short timelines (2-5y) | \$300-500M | 70% | 20% | 10% | Maximize alignment progress |
| Medium timelines (5-15y) | \$200-350M | 55% | 30% | 15% | Build institutions + research |
| Long timelines (15+y) | \$150-250M | 45% | 35% | 20% | Institutional capacity |

<EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving's</EntityLink> 2025 RFP commits at least \$40M to technical AI safety, with potential for "substantially more depending on application quality." Priority areas marked include agent safety, interpretability, and evaluation methods.
