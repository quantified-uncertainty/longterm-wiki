## Overview

<EntityLink id="racing-dynamics">Racing dynamics</EntityLink> create systemic pressure for AI developers to prioritize speed over safety through competitive market forces. This model quantifies how multi-actor competition reduces safety investment by 30-60% compared to coordinated scenarios and increases catastrophic risk probability through measurable causal pathways.

The model demonstrates that even when all actors prefer safe outcomes, structural incentives create a <EntityLink id="multipolar-trap">multipolar trap</EntityLink> where rational individual choices lead to collectively irrational outcomes. Current evidence shows release cycles compressed from 18-24 months (2020) to 3-6 months (2024-2025), with DeepSeek's R1 release intensifying competitive pressure globally.

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence | Timeline |
|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Current Severity** | High | 30-60% reduction in safety investment vs. coordination | Ongoing |
| **Probability** | Very High (85-95%) | Observable across all major AI labs | Active |
| **Trend Direction** | Rapidly Worsening | Release cycles halved, DeepSeek acceleration | Next 2-5 years |
| **Reversibility** | Low | Structural competitive forces, limited coordination success | Requires major intervention |

## Structural Mechanisms

### Core Game Theory

The racing dynamic follows a classic prisoner's dilemma structure:

| Lab Strategy | Competitor Invests Safety | Competitor Cuts Corners |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| **Invest Safety** | (Good, Good) - Slow but safe progress | (Terrible, Excellent) - Fall behind, unsafe AI develops |
| **Cut Corners** | (Excellent, Terrible) - Gain advantage | (Bad, Bad) - Fast but dangerous race |

**Nash Equilibrium**: Both cut corners, despite mutual safety investment being Pareto optimal.

### Competitive Structure Analysis

| Factor | Current State | <EntityLink id="racing-intensity">Racing Intensity</EntityLink> | Source |
|--------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| **Lab Count** | 5-7 frontier labs | High - prevents coordination | <R id="67242d35f03b20a1"><EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink></R>, <R id="e9aaa7b5e18f9f41"><EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink></R> |
| **Concentration (CR4)** | ≈75% market share | Medium - some consolidation | <R id="9c49c7c29ce5d079"><EntityLink id="epoch-ai">Epoch AI</EntityLink></R> |
| **Geopolitical Rivalry** | US-China competition | Critical - national security framing | <R id="10f716f6853c487a">CNAS</R> |
| **Open Source Pressure** | Multiple competing models | High - forces rapid releases | <R id="240ca564b6b827bd">Meta</R> |

### Feedback Loop Dynamics

**Capability Acceleration Loop** (3-12 month cycles):
- Better models → More users → More data/compute → Better models
- **Current Evidence**: ChatGPT 100M users in 2 months, driving rapid GPT-4 development

**Talent Concentration Loop** (12-36 month cycles):
- Leading position → Attracts top researchers → Faster progress → Stronger position
- **Current Evidence**: <R id="5fa46de681ff9902">Anthropic</R> hiring sprees, <R id="e9aaa7b5e18f9f41">OpenAI</R> researcher poaching

**Media Attention Loop** (1-6 month cycles):
- Public demos → Media coverage → Political pressure → Reduced oversight
- **Current Evidence**: ChatGPT launch driving Congressional AI hearings focused on competition, not safety

## Impact Quantification

- **Historical analogues** from other high-stakes technology races

## Current Trajectory Projections

### Baseline Scenario (No Major Interventions)

**2025-2027: Acceleration Phase**
- Racing intensity increases following DeepSeek impact
- Safety investment continues declining as percentage of total
- First major incidents from inadequate evaluation
- Industry commitments increasingly hollow

**2027-2030: Critical Phase**
- Coordination attempts fail under competitive pressure
- Government intervention increases (national security priority)
- Possible U.S.-China AI development bifurcation
- Safety subordinated to capability competition

**Post-2030: <EntityLink id="lock-in">Lock-in</EntityLink> Risk**
- If AGI achieved: Racing may lock in unsafe development trajectory
- If capability plateau: Potential breathing room for safety catch-up
- International governance depends on earlier coordination success

**Estimated probability**: 60-75% without intervention

### Coordination Success Scenario

**2025-2027: Agreement Phase**
- International safety standards established
- Major labs implement binding evaluation frameworks
- Regulatory frameworks begin enforcement

**2027-2030: Stabilization**
- Safety becomes competitive requirement
- Industry consolidation around safety-compliant leaders
- Sustained coordination mechanisms

**Estimated probability**: 15-25%
