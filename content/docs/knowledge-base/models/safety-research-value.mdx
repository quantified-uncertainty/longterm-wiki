## Overview

This economic model quantifies the expected value of marginal investments in AI safety research. Current global spending of ≈\$100M annually on safety research appears significantly below optimal levels, with analysis suggesting 2-5x returns available in neglected areas.

Key findings: Safety research could reduce AI catastrophic risk by 20-40% over the next decade, with particularly high returns in alignment theory and governance research. Current 100:1 ratio of capabilities to safety spending creates systematic underinvestment in risk mitigation.

The model incorporates deep uncertainty about AI risk probabilities (1-20% existential risk this century), tractability of safety problems, and optimal resource allocation across different research approaches.

## Risk/Impact Assessment

| Factor | Assessment | Evidence | Source |
|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Current Underinvestment** | High | 100:1 capabilities vs safety ratio | <R id="342acf7e721544e6"><EntityLink id="epoch-ai">Epoch AI</EntityLink> (2024)</R> |
| **Marginal Returns** | Medium-High | 2-5x potential in neglected areas | <R id="2aa20a88a0b0cbcf"><EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink></R> |
| **Timeline Sensitivity** | High | Value drops 50%+ if timelines \&lt;5 years | <R id="38eba87d0a888e2e"><EntityLink id="ai-impacts">AI Impacts</EntityLink> Survey</R> |
| **Research Direction Risk** | Medium | 10-100x variance between approaches | Analysis based on expert interviews |

## Strategic Framework

### Core Expected Value Equation

```
EV = P(AI catastrophe) × R(research impact) × V(prevented harm) - C(research costs)

Where:
- P ∈ [0.01, 0.20]: Probability of catastrophic AI outcome
- R ∈ [0.05, 0.40]: Fractional risk reduction from research
- V ≈ \$10¹⁵-10¹⁷: Value of prevented catastrophic harm
- C ≈ \$10⁹: Annual research investment
```

### Investment Priority Matrix

| Research Area | Current Annual Funding | Marginal Returns | Evidence Quality |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Alignment Theory** | \$50M | High (5-10x) | Low |
| **Interpretability** | \$175M | Medium (2-3x) | Medium |
| **Evaluations** | \$100M | High (3-5x) | High |
| **Governance Research** | \$50M | High (4-8x) | Medium |
| **RLHF/Fine-tuning** | \$125M | Low (1-2x) | High |

## Current State & Trajectory

### 2024 Funding Landscape

**Total AI safety funding:** ≈\$500-700M globally

| Source | Amount | Growth Rate | Key Players |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Tech companies | \$300M | +50%/year | Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind |
| Philanthropy | \$200M | +30%/year | Coefficient Giving, FTX regrants |
| Government | \$100M | +100%/year | NIST, UK AISI, EU |
| Academia | \$50M | +20%/year | Stanford HAI, MIT, Berkeley |

### 2025-2030 Projections

**Scenario: Moderate scaling**
- Total funding grows to \$2-5B by 2030
- Government share increases from 15% to 40%
- Industry maintains 50-60% share

**Bottlenecks limiting growth:**
1. **Talent pipeline:** ~1,000 qualified researchers globally
2. **Research direction clarity:** Uncertainty about most valuable approaches
3. **Access to frontier models:** Safety research requires cutting-edge systems

## Key Uncertainties & Research Cruxes

### Fundamental Disagreements

| Dimension | Optimistic View | Pessimistic View | Current Evidence |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| **AI Risk Level** | 2-5% x-risk probability | 15-20% x-risk probability | <R id="3b9fda03b8be71dc">Expert surveys</R> show 5-10% median |
| **Alignment Tractability** | Solvable with sufficient research | Fundamentally intractable | Mixed signals from early work |
| **Timeline Sensitivity** | Decades to solve problems | Need solutions in 3-7 years | Acceleration in capabilities suggests shorter timelines |
| **Research Transferability** | Insights transfer across architectures | Approach-specific solutions | Limited evidence either way |

### Critical Research Questions

**Empirical questions that would change investment priorities:**

1. **Interpretability scaling:** Do current techniques work on 100B+ parameter models?
2. **Alignment tax:** What performance cost do safety measures impose?
3. **Adversarial robustness:** Can safety measures withstand optimization pressure?
4. **Governance effectiveness:** Do AI safety standards actually get implemented?

### Information Value Estimates

**Value of resolving key uncertainties:**

| Question | Value of Information | Timeline to Resolution |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Alignment difficulty | \$1-10B | 3-7 years |
| Interpretability scaling | \$500M-5B | 2-5 years |
| Governance effectiveness | \$100M-1B | 5-10 years |
| Risk probability | \$10-100B | Uncertain |
