## Overview

This model analyzes the diffusion of AI capabilities from frontier laboratories to progressively broader populations of actors. It examines <EntityLink id="E232">proliferation</EntityLink> mechanisms, control points, and the relationship between diffusion speed and risk accumulation. The central question: **How fast do dangerous AI capabilities spread from frontier labs to millions of users, and which intervention points offer meaningful leverage?**

Key findings show proliferation follows predictable tier-based patterns, but time constants are compressing dramatically. Capabilities that took 24-36 months to diffuse from Tier 1 (frontier labs) to Tier 4 (open source) in 2020 now spread in 12-18 months. Projections suggest 6-12 month cycles by 2025-2026, fundamentally changing governance calculus.

The model identifies an "<EntityLink id="E179">irreversibility</EntityLink> threshold" where proliferation cannot be reversed once capabilities reach open source. This threshold is crossed earlier than commonly appreciated—often before policymakers recognize capabilities as dangerous. High-leverage interventions must occur pre-proliferation; post-proliferation controls offer diminishing returns as diffusion accelerates.

## Risk Assessment Framework

| Risk Dimension | Current Assessment | 2025-2026 Projection | Evidence | Trend |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|-------|
| **Diffusion Speed** | High | Very High | 50% reduction in proliferation timelines since 2020 | Accelerating |
| **Control Window** | Medium | Low | 12-18 month average control periods | Shrinking |
| **Actor Proliferation** | High | Very High | Tier 4 access growing exponentially | Expanding |
| **Irreversibility Risk** | High | Extreme | Multiple capabilities already irreversibly proliferated | Increasing |

## Proliferation Tier Analysis

### Actor Tier Classification

The proliferation cascade operates through five distinct actor tiers, each with different access mechanisms, resource requirements, and risk profiles.

| Tier | Actor Type | Count | Access Mechanism | Diffusion Time | Control Feasibility |
|------|------------|-------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Frontier Labs | 5-10 | Original development | - | High (concentrated) |
| **2** | Major Tech | 50-100 | API/Partnerships | 6-18 months | Medium-High |
| **3** | Well-Resourced Orgs | 1K-10K | Fine-tuning/Replication | 12-24 months | Medium |
| **4** | Open Source | Millions | Public weights | 18-36 months | Very Low |
| **5** | Individuals | Billions | Consumer apps | 24-48 months | None |

### Historical Diffusion Data

Analysis of actual proliferation timelines reveals accelerating diffusion across multiple capability domains:

| Capability | Tier 1 Date | Tier 4 Date | Total Time | Key Events |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **GPT-3 level** | May 2020 | Jul 2022 | 26 months | OpenAI → HuggingFace release |
| **DALL-E level** | Jan 2021 | Aug 2022 | 19 months | OpenAI → Stable Diffusion |
| **GPT-4 level** | Mar 2023 | Jan 2025 | 22 months | OpenAI → DeepSeek-R1 |
| **Code generation** | Aug 2021 | Dec 2022 | 16 months | Codex → StarCoder |
| **Protein folding** | Nov 2020 | Jul 2021 | 8 months | AlphaFold → ColabFold |

## Mathematical Model

### Core Risk Equation

Total proliferation risk combines actor count, capability level, and misuse probability:

$$R_{\text{total}}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{5} N_i(t) \cdot C_i(t) \cdot P_{\text{misuse},i}$$

Where:
- $N_i(t)$ = Number of actors in tier $i$ with access at time $t$
- $C_i(t)$ = Capability level accessible to tier $i$ at time $t$  
- $P_{\text{misuse},i}$ = Per-actor misuse probability for tier $i$

### Diffusion Dynamics

Each tier transition follows modified logistic growth with accelerating rates:

$$N_i(t) = \frac{N_{i,\max}}{1 + e^{-k_i(t - t_{0,i})}}$$

The acceleration factor captures increasing diffusion speed:

$$k_i(t) = k_{i,0} \cdot e^{\alpha t}$$

With $\alpha \approx 0.15$ per year, implying diffusion rates double every ~5 years. This matches observed compression from 24-36 month cycles (2020) to 12-18 months (2024).

## Control Point Effectiveness

### High-Leverage Interventions

| Control Point | Effectiveness | Durability | Implementation Difficulty | Current Status |
|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Compute governance** | 70-85% | 5-15 years | High | <R id="ce78270338a5b946">Partial (US export controls)</R> |

## Proliferation Scenarios

### 2025-2030 Trajectory Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Tier 1-4 Time | Key Drivers | Risk Level |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Accelerating openness** | 35% | 3-6 months | Open-source ideology, regulation failure | Very High |

| **Effective control** | 10% | 24+ months | Strong compute governance, industry agreement | Low-Medium |

### Threshold Analysis

Critical proliferation thresholds mark qualitative shifts in control feasibility:

| Threshold | Description | Control Status | Response Window |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Contained** | Tier 1-2 only | Control possible | Months |
| **Organizational** | Tier 3 access | State/criminal access likely | Weeks |

## Risk by Actor Type

### Misuse Probability Assessment

Different actor types present distinct risk profiles based on capability access and motivation:

| Actor Type | Estimated Count | Capability Access | P(Access) | P(Misuse\|Access) | Risk Weight |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Hostile state programs** | 5-15 | Frontier | 0.95 | 0.15-0.40 | Very High |
| **Major criminal orgs** | 50-200 | Near-frontier | 0.70-0.85 | 0.30-0.60 | High |
| **Terrorist groups** | 100-500 | Moderate | 0.40-0.70 | 0.50-0.80 | High |
| **Ideological groups** | 1K-10K | Moderate | 0.50-0.80 | 0.10-0.30 | Medium |
| **Malicious individuals** | 10K-100K | Basic-Moderate | 0.60-0.90 | 0.01-0.10 | Medium (scale) |

### Expected Misuse Events

Even low individual misuse probabilities become concerning at scale:

$$E[\text{misuse events}] = \sum_i N_i \cdot P(\text{access})_i \cdot P(\text{misuse}|\text{access})_i$$

For Tier 4-5 proliferation with 100,000 capable actors and 5% misuse probability, expected annual misuse events: **5,000**.

## Current State & Trajectory

### Recent Developments

The proliferation landscape has shifted dramatically since 2023:

**2023 Developments:**
- <R id="d2f67176f1bc7b5b">LLaMA leak</R> demonstrated fragility of controlled releases
- <R id="69c685f410104791">LLaMA 2 open release</R> established new norm for frontier model sharing
- <R id="ce78270338a5b946">U.S. export controls</R> on advanced semiconductors implemented

**2024-2025 Developments:**
- <R id="afad87e802e53736">DeepSeek R1 release</R> achieved GPT-4 level performance with open weights
- <R id="91401135c6d09d96">Qwen 2.5</R> and <R id="aa1786bb9025867e">Mistral</R> continued aggressive open-source strategy
- Chinese labs increasingly releasing frontier capabilities openly

### 2025-2030 Projections

**Accelerating Factors:**
- Algorithmic efficiency reducing compute requirements ~2x annually
- China developing domestic chip capabilities to circumvent controls
- Open-source ideology gaining ground in AI community
- Economic incentives for ecosystem building through open models

**Decelerating Factors:**
- Growing awareness of proliferation risks among frontier labs
- Potential regulatory intervention following AI incidents
- Voluntary industry agreements on responsible disclosure
- Technical barriers to replicating frontier training runs

### Critical Unknown Parameters

| Uncertainty | Impact on Model | Current State | Resolution Timeline |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Chinese chip development** | Very High | 2-3 generations behind | 3-7 years |
| **Algorithmic efficiency gains** | High | ≈2x annual improvement | Ongoing |
| **Open vs closed norms** | Very High | Trending toward open | 1-3 years |
| **Regulatory intervention** | High | Minimal but increasing | 2-5 years |
| **Major AI incident** | Very High | None yet | Unpredictable |

### Model Sensitivity Analysis

The model is most sensitive to three parameters:

**Diffusion Rate Acceleration (α):** 10% change in α yields 25-40% change in risk estimates over 5-year horizon. This parameter depends heavily on continued algorithmic progress and open-source community growth.

**Tier 4/5 Misuse Probability:** Uncertainty ranges from 1-15% create order-of-magnitude differences in expected incidents. Better empirical data on malicious actor populations is critical.

**Compute Control Durability:** Estimates ranging from 3-15 years until circumvention dramatically affect intervention value. China's semiconductor progress is the key uncertainty.

## Policy Implications

### Immediate Actions (0-18 months)

**Strengthen Compute Governance:**
- Expand semiconductor export controls to cover training and inference chips
- Implement cloud provider monitoring for large training runs
- Establish international coordination on chip supply chain security

**Establish Evaluation Frameworks:**
- Define dangerous capability thresholds with measurable criteria
- Create mandatory pre-deployment evaluation requirements
- Build verification infrastructure for model capabilities

### Medium-Term Priorities (18 months-5 years)

**International Coordination:**
- Negotiate binding agreements on proliferation control
- Establish verification mechanisms for training run detection
- Create sanctions framework for violating proliferation norms

**Industry Standards:**
- Implement weight security requirements for frontier models
- Establish differential access policies based on actor verification
- Create liability frameworks for irresponsible proliferation

### Long-Term Structural Changes (5+ years)

**Governance Architecture:**
- Build adaptive regulatory systems that evolve with technology
- Establish international AI safety organization with enforcement powers
- Create sustainable funding for proliferation monitoring infrastructure

**Research Priorities:**
- Develop better offensive-defensive balance understanding
- Create empirical measurement systems for proliferation tracking
- Build tools for post-proliferation risk mitigation

## Research Gaps

Several critical uncertainties limit model precision and policy effectiveness:

**Empirical Proliferation Tracking:** Systematic measurement of capability diffusion timelines across domains remains limited. Most analysis relies on high-profile case studies rather than comprehensive data collection.

**Reverse Engineering Difficulty:** Time and resources required to replicate capabilities from limited information varies dramatically across capability types. Better understanding could inform targeted protection strategies.

**Actor Intent Modeling:** Current misuse probability estimates rely on theoretical analysis rather than empirical study of malicious actor populations and motivations.

**Control Mechanism Effectiveness:** Rigorous testing of governance interventions is lacking. Most effectiveness estimates derive from analogies to other domains rather than AI-specific validation.

**Defensive Capability Development:** The model focuses on capability proliferation while ignoring parallel development of defensive tools that could partially offset risks.
