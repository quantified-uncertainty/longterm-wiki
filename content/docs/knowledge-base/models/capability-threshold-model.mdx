## Overview

Different AI risks require different capability levels to become dangerous. A system that can write convincing phishing emails poses different risks than one that can autonomously discover zero-day vulnerabilities. This model maps specific capability requirements to specific risks, helping predict when risks activate as capabilities improve.

The capability threshold model provides a structured framework for understanding how AI systems transition from relatively benign to potentially dangerous across multiple risk domains. Rather than treating AI capability as a single dimension or risks as uniformly dependent on general intelligence, this model recognizes that specific risks emerge when systems cross particular capability thresholds in relevant dimensions. According to the <R id="6acf3be7a03c2328">International AI Safety Report (October 2025)</R>, governance choices in 2025-2026 must internalize that capability scaling has decoupled from parameter count, meaning risk thresholds can be crossed between annual cycles.

Key findings include 15-25% benchmark performance indicating early risk emergence, 50% marking qualitative shifts to complex autonomous execution, and most critical thresholds estimated to cross between 2025-2029 across misuse, control, and structural risk categories. The <R id="df46edd6fa2078d1"><EntityLink id="fli">Future of Life Institute</EntityLink>'s 2025 AI Safety Index</R> reveals an industry struggling to keep pace with its own rapid capability advances, with companies claiming AGI achievement within the decade yet none scoring above D in existential safety planning.

## Capability Dimensions Framework

AI capabilities decompose into five distinct dimensions that progress at different rates. Understanding these separately is crucial because different risks require different combinations. According to <R id="b029bfc231e620cc"><EntityLink id="epoch-ai">Epoch AI</EntityLink>'s tracking</R>, the training compute of frontier AI models has grown by 5x per year since 2020, and the Epoch Capabilities Index shows frontier model improvement nearly doubled in 2024, from ~8 points/year to ~15 points/year.

### Domain Knowledge Benchmarks

Current measurement approaches show significant gaps in assessing practical domain expertise:

| Domain | Best Benchmark | Current Frontier Score | Expert Human Level | Assessment Quality |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Biology | <R id="0635974beafcf9c5">MMLU-Biology</R> | 85-90% | ≈95% | Medium |
| Chemistry | <R id="07f6e283ae954643">ChemBench</R> | 70-80% | ≈90% | Low |
| Computer Security | <R id="f947a6c44d755d2f">SecBench</R> | 65-75% | ≈85% | Low |
| Psychology | MMLU-Psychology | 80-85% | ≈90% | Very Low |
| Medicine | <R id="db13f518d99c0810">MedQA</R> | 85-90% | ≈95% | Medium |

*Assessment quality reflects how well benchmarks capture practical expertise versus academic knowledge.*

### Reasoning Depth Progression

The <R id="f369a16dd38155b8">ARC Prize 2024-2025 results</R> demonstrate the critical threshold zone for complex reasoning. On ARC-AGI-1, OpenAI's o3-preview achieved 75.7% accuracy (near human level of 98%), while on the harder ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, even advanced models score only single-digit percentages, yet humans can solve every task.

| Reasoning Level | Benchmark Examples | Current Performance | Risk Relevance |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Simple (2-3 steps) | Basic math word problems | 95%+ | Low-risk applications |
| Moderate (5-10 steps) | <R id="edaaae1b94942ea9">GSM8K</R>, multi-hop QA | 85-95% | Most current capabilities |
| Complex (20+ steps) | <R id="e9af36b12ddcc94c">ARC-AGI</R>, extended proofs | 30-75% (ARC-AGI-1), 5-55% (ARC-AGI-2) | **Critical threshold zone** |
| Superhuman | Novel mathematical proofs | \&lt;10% | Advanced risks |

**Recent breakthrough (December 2025):** <R id="f369a16dd38155b8">Poetiq with GPT-5.2 X-High</R> achieved 75% on ARC-AGI-2, surpassing the average human test-taker score of 60% for the first time, demonstrating rapid progress on complex reasoning tasks.

## Risk-Capability Mapping

### Near-Term Risks (2025-2027)

#### Authentication Collapse

The volume of deepfakes has grown explosively: <R id="270a29b59196c942">Deloitte's 2024 analysis</R> estimates growth from roughly 500,000 online deepfakes in 2023 to about 8 million in 2025, with annual growth nearing 900%. Voice cloning has crossed what experts call the "indistinguishable threshold"--a few seconds of audio now suffice to generate a convincing clone.

| Capability | Required Level | Current Level | Gap | Evidence |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----|----------|
| Domain Knowledge (Media) | Expert | Expert- | 0.5 level | <R id="3182b02b8073e217">Sora quality</R> approaching photorealism |
| Reasoning Depth | Moderate | Moderate | 0 levels | Current models handle multi-step generation |
| Strategic Modeling | Basic+ | Basic | 0.5 level | Limited theory of mind in current systems |
| Autonomous Execution | Simple | Simple | 0 levels | Already achieved for content generation |

**Key Threshold Capabilities:**
- Generate synthetic content indistinguishable from authentic across all modalities
- Real-time interactive video generation (<R id="ff0d3b0d87f3e276">NVIDIA Omniverse</R>)
- Defeat detection systems designed to identify AI content
- Mimic individual styles from minimal samples

**Detection Challenges:** <R id="7cee14cf2f24d687">OpenAI's deepfake detection tool</R> identifies DALL-E 3 images with 98.8% accuracy but only flags 5-10% of images from other AI tools. Multi-modal attacks combining deepfaked video, synthetic voices, and fabricated documents are increasing.

**Current Status:** <R id="3182b02b8073e217">OpenAI's Sora</R> and <R id="8e92648dccb54c91">Meta's Make-A-Video</R> demonstrate near-threshold video generation. <R id="5a71dcde353b55d6">ElevenLabs</R> achieves voice cloning from \&lt;30 seconds of audio.

#### Mass Persuasion Capabilities

| Capability | Required Level | Current Level | Gap | Evidence |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----|----------|
| Domain Knowledge (Psychology) | Graduate+ | Graduate | 0.5 level | Strong performance on psychology benchmarks |
| Strategic Modeling | Sophisticated | Basic+ | 1 level | Limited multi-agent reasoning |
| Planning Horizon | Medium-term | Short-term | 1 level | Cannot maintain campaigns over weeks |
| Autonomous Execution | Simple | Simple | 0 levels | Can generate content at scale |

**Research Evidence:**
- <R id="81908b7f23602e1c">Anthropic (2024)</R> shows Claude 3 achieves 84% on psychology benchmarks
- <R id="9fc081c471fb3bb0">Stanford HAI study</R> finds AI-generated content 82% higher believability
- <R id="9e3c9400f4428304">MIT persuasion study</R> demonstrates automated A/B testing improves persuasion by 35%

### Medium-Term Risks (2026-2029)

#### Bioweapons Development

| Capability | Required Level | Current Level | Gap | Assessment Source |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----|------------------|
| Domain Knowledge (Biology) | Expert | Graduate+ | 1 level | <R id="0fe4cfa7ca5f2270">RAND biosecurity assessment</R> |
| Domain Knowledge (Chemistry) | Expert | Graduate | 1-2 levels | Limited synthesis knowledge |
| Reasoning Depth | Complex | Moderate+ | 1 level | Cannot handle 20+ step procedures |
| Planning Horizon | Medium-term | Short-term | 1 level | No multi-week experimental planning |
| Autonomous Execution | Complex | Simple+ | 1 level | Cannot troubleshoot failed experiments |

**Critical Bottlenecks:**
- Specialized synthesis knowledge for dangerous compounds
- Autonomous troubleshooting of complex laboratory procedures
- Multi-week experimental planning and adaptation
- Integration of theoretical knowledge with practical constraints

**Expert Assessment:** <R id="0fe4cfa7ca5f2270">RAND Corporation (2024)</R> estimates 60% probability of crossing threshold by 2028.

#### Economic Displacement Thresholds

<R id="417f66880659ef93">McKinsey's research</R> indicates that current technologies could automate about 57% of U.S. work hours in theory. By 2030, approximately 27% of current work hours in Europe and 30% in the United States could be automated. Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in highest-wage positions.

| Job Category | Automation Threshold | Current AI Capability | Estimated Timeline | Source |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Content Writing | 70% task automation | 85% | **Crossed 2024** | <R id="66b16a95bae9dc49">McKinsey AI Index</R> |
| Code Generation | 60% task automation | 60-70% (SWE-bench Verified) | **Crossed 2025** | <R id="433a37bad4e66a78">SWE-bench leaderboard</R> |
| Data Analysis | 75% task automation | 55% | 2026-2027 | Industry surveys |
| Customer Service | 80% task automation | 70% | 2025-2026 | <R id="b754cf0b7655c452">Salesforce AI reports</R> |
| Legal Research | 65% task automation | 40% | 2027-2028 | Legal industry analysis |

**Coding Benchmark Update:** The <R id="6acf3be7a03c2328">International AI Safety Report (October 2025)</R> notes that coding capabilities have advanced particularly quickly. Top models now solve over 60% of problems in SWE-bench Verified, up from 40% in late 2024 and almost 0% at the beginning of 2024. However, <R id="a23789853c1c33f2">Scale AI's SWE-Bench Pro</R> shows a significant performance drop: even the best models (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1) score only 23% on harder, more realistic tasks.

### Long-Term Control Risks (2027-2035+)

#### Strategic Deception (Scheming)

| Capability | Required Level | Current Level | Gap | Uncertainty |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|-----|-------------|
| Strategic Modeling | Superhuman | Basic+ | 2+ levels | Very High |
| Reasoning Depth | Complex | Moderate+ | 1 level | High |
| Planning Horizon | Long-term | Short-term | 2 levels | Very High |
| Situational Awareness | Expert | Basic | 2 levels | High |

**Key Uncertainties:**
- Whether sophisticated strategic modeling can emerge from current training approaches
- Detectability of strategic deception capabilities during evaluation
- Minimum capability level required for effective scheming

**Research Evidence:**
- <R id="683aef834ac1612a">Anthropic Constitutional AI</R> shows limited success in detecting deceptive behavior
- <R id="42e7247cbc33fc4c">Redwood Research</R> adversarial training reveals capabilities often hidden during evaluation

## Current State & Trajectory

### Capability Progress Rates

According to <R id="7d0515f6079d8beb">Epoch AI's analysis</R>, training compute for frontier models grows 4-5x yearly. Their Epoch Capabilities Index shows frontier model improvement nearly doubled in 2024. <R id="89b92e6423256fc4">METR's research</R> shows AI performance on task length has been consistently exponentially increasing over the past 6 years, with a doubling time of around 7 months.

| Dimension | 2023-2024 Progress | Projected 2024-2025 | Key Drivers |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Domain Knowledge | +0.5 levels | +0.3-0.7 levels | Larger training datasets, specialized fine-tuning |
| Reasoning Depth | +0.3 levels | +0.2-0.5 levels | Chain-of-thought improvements, tree search |

| Autonomous Execution | +0.4 levels | +0.3-0.6 levels | Tool use, real-world deployment |

**Data Sources:** <R id="120adc539e2fa558">Epoch AI capability tracking</R>, industry benchmark results, expert elicitation.

### Compute Scaling Projections

| Metric | Current (2025) | Projected 2027 | Projected 2030 | Source |

### Leading Organizations

| Organization | Strongest Capabilities | Estimated Timeline to Next Threshold | Focus Area |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|
| <R id="04d39e8bd5d50dd5">OpenAI</R> | Domain knowledge, autonomous execution | 12-18 months | General capabilities |
| <R id="afe2508ac4caf5ee">Anthropic</R> | Reasoning depth, strategic modeling | 18-24 months | Safety-focused development |

| <R id="278254c1e0630e9d">Meta</R> | Multimodal generation | 6-12 months | Social/media applications |

## Key Uncertainties & Research Cruxes

### Measurement Validity

The <R id="d1774c2286e7c730">Berkeley CLTC Working Paper on Intolerable Risk Thresholds</R> notes that models effectively more capable than the latest tested model (4x or more in Effective Compute or 6 months worth of fine-tuning) require comprehensive assessment including threat model mapping, empirical capability tests, elicitation testing without safety mechanisms, and likelihood forecasting.

An <R id="c5a21da9e0c0cdeb">interdisciplinary review of AI evaluation</R> highlights the "benchmark lottery" problem: researchers at Google's Brain Team found that many factors other than fundamental algorithmic superiority may lead to a method being perceived as superior. Ironically, a majority of influential benchmarks have been released without rigorous peer review.

| Uncertainty | Impact if True | Impact if False | Current Evidence |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Current benchmarks accurately measure risk-relevant capabilities | Can trust threshold predictions | Need fundamentally new evaluations | Mixed - good for some domains, poor for others |
| Practical capabilities match benchmark performance | Smooth transition from lab to deployment | Significant capability overhangs | Substantial gaps observed in real-world deployment |
| Capability improvements follow predictable scaling laws | Reliable timeline forecasting possible | Threshold crossings may surprise | Scaling laws hold for some capabilities, not others |

### Threshold Sharpness

**Sharp Threshold Evidence:**
- <R id="6125e188a886af2d">Authentication systems</R>: Detection accuracy drops from 95% to 15% once generation quality crosses threshold
- Economic viability: <R id="66b16a95bae9dc49">McKinsey automation analysis</R> shows 10-20% capability improvements create 50-80% cost advantage in many tasks
- Security vulnerabilities: Most exploits require complete capability to work at all

**Gradual Scaling Evidence:**
- Job displacement: Different tasks within roles automate at different rates
- Persuasion effectiveness: Incremental improvements in messaging quality yield incremental persuasion gains
- Domain expertise: Knowledge accumulation appears continuous rather than threshold-based

### Strategic Deception Detection

Critical unsolved problems in capability assessment:

| Challenge | Current Approach | Limitation | Research Need |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| Detecting hidden capabilities | Red-teaming, adversarial prompts | Systems may hide abilities during evaluation | Novel evaluation paradigms |
| Measuring situational awareness | Direct questioning, inference tests | Pattern matching vs. genuine understanding | Causal intervention studies |
| Long-term planning assessment | Multi-step benchmarks | Maximum tested horizon ~hours | Extended evaluation infrastructure |
| Strategic modeling depth | Theory of mind tasks | Unclear if results generalize | Ecological validity research |

## Timeline Projections & Warning Indicators

### 2025 Critical Thresholds

**High Probability (70%+):**
- **Authentication Collapse:** Real-time deepfakes become commercially viable
- **Content Generation Saturation:** Human-level quality across all text/image modalities

**Medium Probability (40-70%):**
- **Code Automation:** 50%+ of software engineering tasks automated
- **Basic Situational Awareness:** Systems understand evaluation vs. deployment contexts

### 2026-2027 Medium Probability Events

| Risk | Probability | Key Indicators to Monitor |
|------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Advanced Cyberweapons | 65% | <R id="45370a5153534152">METR evaluations</R> crossing 40% threshold |
| Economic Disruption | 80% | <R id="561b4078010f62e3">GitHub Copilot</R> achieving >60% task completion |
| Bioweapons Uplift | 40% | Expert biology benchmarks >90%, synthesis knowledge tests |
| Oversight Evasion | 60% | Detection of training/deployment context awareness |

### Early Warning System

**Red Flag Indicators:**
- Sudden benchmark improvements >20 percentage points
- Systems developing capabilities not explicitly trained for
- Gap between capability and safety evaluation results widening
- Evidence of strategic behavior during evaluation

**Monitoring Infrastructure:**
- <R id="45370a5153534152">METR</R> dangerous capability evaluations
- <R id="86df45a5f8a9bf6d">MIRI</R> alignment evaluation protocols
- Industry responsible scaling policies (<R id="90a03954db3c77d5">OpenAI Preparedness</R>, <R id="394ea6d17701b621">Anthropic RSP</R>)
- Academic capability forecasting (<R id="120adc539e2fa558">Epoch AI</R>)

The <R id="c8782940b880d00f">METR Common Elements Report (December 2025)</R> describes how each major AI developer's policy uses capability thresholds for biological weapons development, cyberattacks, autonomous replication, and automated AI R&D, with commitments to conduct model evaluations assessing whether models are approaching thresholds that could enable severe harm.

### Expert Survey Findings

An <R id="169aa2527260ab17">OECD-affiliated survey on AI thresholds</R> found that experts agreed if training compute thresholds are exceeded, AI companies should:
- Conduct additional risk assessments (e.g., via model evaluations)
- Notify an independent public body (e.g., EU AI Office, FTC, or AI Safety Institute)
- Notify the government

Participants noted that risk assessment frameworks from safety-critical industries (nuclear, maritime, aviation, healthcare, finance, space) provide valuable precedent for AI governance.
