## Quick Assessment

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Core Question** | If transformative AI arrives in 1-5 years, what should policy prioritize? |
| **Key Insight** | Short timelines dramatically shift the cost-benefit calculus of interventions |
| **Most Urgent** | Lab security, compute monitoring, safety culture, emergency coordination mechanisms |
| **Less Viable** | Long-term institution building, public opinion shifts, comprehensive legislation |
| **Key Tradeoff** | Speed vs. thoroughness in governance responses |

## Overview

This article assumes short AI timelines (transformative AI within 1-5 years) and works through the policy implications. The question is not whether timelines are short - that's covered elsewhere - but rather: **given short timelines, what changes?**

Short timelines fundamentally alter the strategic landscape because:

1. **Time is the scarcest resource** - Interventions requiring 5+ years to implement become ineffective
2. **Institutional adaptation lags** - Governments and regulators move slowly; most won't adapt in time
3. **Path dependence increases** - Early decisions lock in harder when change happens fast
4. **Coordination becomes harder** - Less time to build trust, negotiate, and iterate

The implications cut across what governments should do, what labs should do, what researchers should prioritize, and what the safety community should focus on.

## Policy Interventions That Become More Important

### Immediate Lab-Level Safety Measures

Under short timelines, **internal lab practices matter far more than external regulation** because:

- Labs can change practices in weeks; legislation takes years
- The most dangerous models will be developed before comprehensive frameworks exist
- Safety culture and incentives within labs determine outcomes

**High-priority lab interventions:**

| Intervention | Why It's Urgent | Implementation Speed |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| <EntityLink id="ai-control">AI control techniques</EntityLink> | Prevents catastrophic outcomes from deployed systems | Weeks to months |
| Internal red-teaming | Catches dangerous capabilities before deployment | Already possible |
| Security protocols (weights, training details) | Prevents <EntityLink id="proliferation">proliferation</EntityLink> during critical period | Months |
| Researcher vetting and insider threat prevention | Reduces misuse/leak risk | Months |
| Staged deployment with monitoring | Catches problems before scale | Already possible |

The key insight is that **persuading 3-5 major labs to implement strong safety practices** may be more tractable and higher-impact than legislative approaches that require broader political consensus.

### <EntityLink id="monitoring">Compute Monitoring</EntityLink> and Thresholds

<EntityLink id="compute-governance">Compute governance</EntityLink> becomes particularly important under short timelines because:

1. **It's already partially implemented** - Export controls, reporting requirements exist
2. **It targets the bottleneck** - Large training runs require identifiable hardware
3. **It can be tightened quickly** - Regulatory adjustments rather than new frameworks

Specific priorities:
- **Mandatory reporting** of training runs above capability thresholds (already in some jurisdictions)
- **Know-your-customer requirements** for cloud compute providers
- **International compute tracking** coordination (challenging but highest-leverage)
- **Emergency provisions** allowing rapid threshold adjustments as capabilities advance

The \$10B+ training clusters expected by 2027-2028 are visible enough that monitoring is feasible. Short timelines mean these clusters may train the most consequential systems, making monitoring them especially important.

### Emergency Coordination Mechanisms

Short timelines mean standard <EntityLink id="international-coordination">international coordination</EntityLink> processes (multi-year treaty negotiations) won't complete in time. Policy should focus on:

1. **Pre-negotiated emergency protocols** - Agreement on what triggers joint action, even if substantive policies aren't agreed
2. **Technical coordination channels** - Direct communication between major lab safety teams and government safety institutes
3. **Incident response frameworks** - Knowing who has authority to act when something goes wrong
4. **Mutual recognition agreements** - Labs accepting each other's safety evaluations to reduce duplication

The goal is infrastructure that can coordinate rapid responses, not comprehensive governance frameworks that won't exist in time.

### Safety Research Prioritization

With limited time, <EntityLink id="technical-ai-safety">safety research</EntityLink> must ruthlessly prioritize:

**Higher priority (can yield results in 1-3 years):**
- <EntityLink id="interpretability">Interpretability</EntityLink> tools for detecting deception/misalignment
- <EntityLink id="evals">Dangerous capability evaluations</EntityLink>
- <EntityLink id="ai-control">Control techniques</EntityLink> (monitoring, sandboxing, tripwires)
- <EntityLink id="scalable-oversight">Scalable oversight</EntityLink> methods that work with current architectures

**Lower priority (unlikely to mature in time):**
- Fundamental theoretical work on alignment
- Novel training paradigms requiring years of development
- Approaches requiring training new frontier models to test

This is controversial - some argue that without theoretical foundations, practical techniques will fail at higher capability levels. But under short timelines, **tools that work for the next 2-3 model generations may be all that matters**.

### Talent Concentration

Short timelines increase the importance of getting the right people into key positions:

- **Safety researchers at frontier labs** - Direct influence on what gets built
- **Technical advisors in government AI offices** - Informed policy guidance
- **Safety-conscious leadership at labs** - Cultural and strategic priorities

Individual hiring and placement decisions may matter more than institutional reforms that won't complete in time. Programs like <EntityLink id="mats">MATS</EntityLink> that place alignment researchers become especially valuable.

## Policy Interventions That Become Less Important

### Long-Term Institution Building

Under short timelines, investments in building new institutions have diminishing returns:

| Intervention | Time to Impact | Short-Timeline Assessment |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| New international <EntityLink id="ai-governance">AI governance</EntityLink> body | 5-10 years | Won't exist in time |
| AI safety degree programs | 5-10 years | Won't produce graduates in time |
| Public AI literacy campaigns | 5-10 years | Unlikely to shift politics in time |
| New regulatory agencies | 3-5 years | May not be staffed/operational in time |

This doesn't mean these are worthless - they matter for longer timelines and for the post-transformative period. But under short timelines, resources invested here have opportunity costs.

### Comprehensive Legislation

Major legislation like the <EntityLink id="eu-ai-act">EU AI Act</EntityLink> takes years to pass and more years to implement. Under short timelines:

- **Implementation timelines extend past the critical period** - EU AI Act high-risk provisions apply August 2026-2027; if transformative AI arrives in 2027, these may be too late
- **Legislation is necessarily backwards-looking** - Written for current systems, not ones developed during implementation
- **Political capital is limited** - Major legislative fights may divert energy from faster interventions

More viable: **executive actions, agency guidance, and regulatory interpretations** that can move faster, even if less durable.

### Public Opinion Campaigns

Shifting public opinion is slow. Under short timelines:

- **Electoral cycles don't align** - Next US presidential term starts 2029; may be too late
- **Issue salience fluctuates** - Public attention is hard to sustain for years
- **Opinion doesn't directly translate to policy** - Even if public supports AI safety measures, implementation takes additional time

Public engagement isn't worthless - it creates political cover for faster-moving interventions and matters for the post-transformative period. But it's not the primary lever under short timelines.

## How Key Tradeoffs Shift

### Speed vs. Quality in Governance

Normally, rushing governance produces bad outcomes - poorly designed regulations, unintended consequences, regulatory capture. Under short timelines, the calculus changes:

- **Imperfect governance now may be better than perfect governance too late**
- **Iteration becomes impossible** - You may only get one shot
- **Reversibility matters less** - If transformative AI changes everything, most regulations become obsolete anyway

This argues for **directionally correct actions with known flaws** over waiting for optimal solutions.

### Innovation vs. Safety

Short timelines intensify this tradeoff:

**Pro-caution argument:** If transformative AI arrives soon, the stakes are highest - we should prioritize getting it right over getting it first.

**Pro-speed argument:** If transformative AI arrives soon, whoever develops it first determines how it goes - we should ensure safety-conscious actors reach the frontier.

Under short timelines, this debate becomes less about abstract principles and more about **specific actors and specific systems**. The question is not "should we slow AI?" but "which AI project, if accelerated or decelerated, would improve outcomes?"

### Domestic vs. International Focus

Short timelines sharply constrain international coordination options:

- **Multilateral treaties** requiring ratification across many nations take too long
- **Bilateral agreements** between major AI powers (US-China, US-EU) are faster but still slow
- **De facto standards** set by leading labs may be the only coordination mechanism that works

This suggests focusing on **technical standards and protocols** that can spread through lab adoption rather than formal governmental agreements.

### Broad vs. Narrow Coalitions

Under short timelines, building broad political coalitions has diminishing returns:

- **Narrow coalitions of key decision-makers** can move faster
- **Lab leadership, top government officials, key technical advisors** may be more tractable targets than broader publics
- **Quality of relationships matters more** - knowing who to call when something goes wrong

This concentrates influence, which has risks. But under time pressure, it may be more effective than broader but slower mobilization.

## Concrete Policy Recommendations by Actor

### For Governments (Short Timeline Scenario)

1. **Staff AI offices with technical expertise immediately** - Don't wait for perfect organizational structures
2. **Use existing authorities creatively** - Export controls, contract requirements, liability rules can be adapted faster than new legislation
3. **Establish emergency coordination with other governments and labs** - Direct communication channels, pre-agreed escalation procedures
4. **Fund near-term safety research directly** - Grants with 1-2 year timelines, not 5-year programs
5. **Prepare contingency plans** - What happens if a lab develops something dangerous? Who has authority to act?

### For AI Labs (Short Timeline Scenario)

1. **Implement <EntityLink id="rsp">responsible scaling policies</EntityLink> with teeth** - Not just commitments but operational procedures
2. **Invest heavily in security** - Weight protection, insider threat prevention, operational security
3. **Hire and empower safety-focused staff** - Not just safety researchers but safety-oriented leadership
4. **Coordinate with other labs on safety standards** - The <EntityLink id="frontier-model-forum">Frontier Model Forum</EntityLink> and similar bodies
5. **Be transparent about capabilities and incidents** - Share information that helps the ecosystem even if costly

### For Safety Researchers (Short Timeline Scenario)

1. **Focus on deployable techniques** - Work that can be implemented in current systems
2. **Build relationships with labs** - Direct influence on deployment decisions
3. **Prioritize empirical work** - Testing techniques on real models rather than theoretical frameworks
4. **Document and share methods** - Make safety techniques easy for labs to adopt
5. **Red-team aggressively** - Find problems before deployment

### For Funders (Short Timeline Scenario)

1. **Accelerate grant timelines** - Shorter application cycles, faster decisions
2. **Fund research with clear 1-2 year deliverables** - Avoid multi-year theoretical projects
3. **Support researcher placement programs** - Getting people into key positions
4. **Fund emergency response capacity** - Organizations that can act quickly when needed
5. **Diversify across bets** - Under uncertainty about which approaches work, portfolio matters

## What If Timelines Are Wrong?

Optimizing for short timelines has costs if timelines turn out longer:

| Short-Timeline Policy | Cost If Timelines Are Long |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Neglecting institution-building | Weak foundations when transformative AI does arrive |
| Rushing governance | Locking in suboptimal frameworks |
| Narrow coalitions | Brittle political support |
| Near-term research focus | Missing fundamental breakthroughs |

**Risk management under uncertainty:** Many short-timeline-favored interventions (<EntityLink id="lab-safety-practices">lab safety practices</EntityLink>, compute monitoring, emergency coordination) remain valuable under longer timelines and don't foreclose longer-term efforts. Prioritizing these "robust" interventions hedges against timeline uncertainty.

The bigger risk may be the opposite: **preparing for long timelines when timelines are actually short**, leaving no time to course-correct.

## Key Uncertainties

1. **How much can lab practices actually improve outcomes?** If misalignment is fundamentally hard, internal practices may not help enough
2. **Will governments act at all?** If political will is absent, government-focused strategies may be moot regardless of timeline
3. **Can safety research produce useful tools fast enough?** Even with prioritization, some problems may require longer research timelines
4. **How much coordination is possible?** Competitive dynamics may prevent cooperation even when everyone would benefit
