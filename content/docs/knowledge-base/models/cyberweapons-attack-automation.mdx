## Overview

This model projects when AI systems will achieve autonomous cyber attack capability, defined as conducting complete attack campaigns with minimal human oversight. Unlike traditional cyber operations requiring extensive human direction, autonomous AI systems can identify targets, develop exploits, execute attacks, and adapt to defenses in real-time across extended campaigns.

**September 2025 marked a critical threshold**: <R id="0e46bc2e525e992b"><EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink> documented</R> the first large-scale AI-orchestrated cyberattack targeting ~30 organizations across tech, finance, and government sectors. This campaign achieved what researchers classify as Level 3 autonomy—AI-directed operations with minimal human intervention.

**Key conclusion**: Current AI systems are approximately 50% of the way to full (Level 4) autonomy, with projections suggesting this capability will emerge between 2029-2033 under moderate development scenarios.
