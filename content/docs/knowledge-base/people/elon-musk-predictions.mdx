llmSummary: Comprehensive documentation of Elon Musk's prediction track record showing systematic overoptimism on timelines (FSD predictions missed by 6+ years across 15+ instances, AGI predictions shift forward annually, Dojo project failed after 6 years). Early AI safety warnings (2014-2017) were prescient and influenced mainstream discourse, but product/capability predictions consistently miss by 3-6+ years with high stated confidence.

This page documents <EntityLink id="E116">Elon Musk</EntityLink>'s public predictions and claims to assess his epistemic track record. For biographical information, controversies, and full context, see the main <EntityLink id="E116">Elon Musk</EntityLink> page.

## Summary Assessment

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Clearly Correct** | 2-3 | Early AI safety warnings, need for regulation discussion |
| **Pending** | 4-5 | AGI timelines, job displacement predictions |
| **Clearly Wrong** | 15+ | FSD timelines (nearly all missed by years), Dojo project |
| **Shifting Goalposts** | Many | AGI predictions move forward each year as deadlines pass |

**Overall pattern**: Prescient on directional safety concerns; consistently overoptimistic on specific product timelines by 3-6+ years; AGI predictions shift annually.

## Full Self-Driving Predictions (Extensively Wrong)

This is a well-documented area of Musk's prediction track record. From 2014-2025, he predicted "full self-driving" would arrive "by end of year" or "next year" virtually every year.

## Accuracy Analysis

**Where Musk tends to be right:**
- Directional AI safety concerns (raised years before mainstream)
- General trajectory of AI importance
- Need for regulatory discussion

**Where Musk tends to be wrong:**
- Specific product timelines (FSD off by 6+ years consistently)
- Capability deployment dates
- Scaling predictions (Neuralink, robotaxis, Dojo)

**Confidence calibration:**
- Expresses extreme confidence ("100% confident," "for sure") on predictions that miss by years
- Rarely acknowledges past prediction failures
- Shifts goalposts without addressing missed deadlines

**Pattern recognition:**
