## Overview

Marc Andreessen is an American businessman, venture capitalist, and former software engineer who played a foundational role in shaping the modern internet and now wields significant influence over AI development through his venture capital firm.[^1] Born on July 9, 1971, in Cedar Falls, Iowa, Andreessen first achieved prominence at age 22 by co-authoring **Mosaic**, the first widely used graphical web browser, which was responsible for a 10,000-fold increase in web users over two years.[^2] He subsequently co-founded Netscape Communications, which captured over 75% of browser market share by mid-1996 and was sold to AOL for \$4.2 billion in 1999.[^3]

In 2009, Andreessen co-founded **Andreessen Horowitz (a16z)** with Ben Horowitz, a venture capital firm that grew from \$300 million in initial capitalization to over \$90 billion under management.[^4] The firm has invested in major technology companies including Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Airbnb, and Coinbase, making Andreessen one of Silicon Valley's most influential investors.[^5] In July 2025, a16z led the largest seed round in history—\$2 billion for AI startup Thinking Machines Lab at a \$12 billion valuation.[^6]

Andreessen has become a prominent voice in debates about technology policy, particularly regarding artificial intelligence. His June 2023 essay "Why AI Will Save the World" and October 2023 "Techno-Optimist Manifesto" sparked widespread debate by dismissing AI existential risk concerns and advocating for maximum-speed AI development.[^7] He argues that any deceleration of AI "will cost lives" and constitutes "a form of murder," positioning himself in direct opposition to AI safety advocates focused on alignment and catastrophic risks.[^8] This stance has made him a controversial figure in AI safety circles, with critics accusing him of employing flawed reasoning and dangerously underestimating misalignment risks.[^9]

## Early Life and Mosaic Development

Andreessen showed early aptitude for computing, teaching himself BASIC programming at age eight.[^10] He earned a bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he worked at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).[^11]

In 1993, while still an undergraduate, Andreessen and programmer Eric Bina worked 80-hour weeks over two months to develop Mosaic, creating an interface that integrated text, graphics, and sound to navigate the World Wide Web.[^12] The NCSA team completed Mosaic in 1993 and released it free over the Internet, achieving extraordinary impact: over 2 million copies were downloaded in the first year.[^13] The browser made the internet accessible to non-technical users for the first time by displaying images inline rather than requiring separate viewing programs.

Andreessen was inducted into the World Wide Web Hall of Fame in 1994 for this achievement.[^14]

## Netscape Communications

In April 1994, at age 22, Andreessen co-founded Mosaic Communications Corporation with James Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics, using \$4 million of Clark's capital.[^15] Andreessen served as vice president of technology and recruited original Mosaic team members, including Eric Bina, to join the new venture.[^16] The company was renamed Netscape Communications Corporation after six months due to a copyright dispute with the University of Illinois over the Mosaic name.[^17]

The new browser was initially called "Mozilla" (short for "Mosaic Killer") by developers but was marketed as Netscape Navigator.[^18] By mid-1996, Netscape Navigator had become the dominant browser, capturing over 75% of market share.[^19] The company reported \$55 million in revenues for the first quarter of 1996 alone.[^20]

In August 1995, Netscape's initial public offering made Andreessen suddenly wealthy; at age 24, he was worth \$56 million on the day of the IPO.[^21] He appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1996, symbolizing the dot-com boom.[^22] On February 18, 1999, AOL acquired Netscape for \$4.3 billion, and Andreessen became Chief Technology Officer at AOL, though he left the position after only six to seven months in September 1999.[^23]

## Post-Netscape Ventures

### Loudcloud/Opsware

In October 1999, Andreessen co-founded Loudcloud, Inc. with Ben Horowitz and others as a web-hosting and e-commerce services company.[^24] The company was later renamed Opsware and focused on data center automation software. In 2007, Hewlett-Packard acquired Opsware for \$1.6 billion.[^25] Andreessen subsequently served on HP's board of directors from 2008 to 2018.[^26]

### Ning

In October 2004, Andreessen co-founded Ning with Gina Bianchini, a platform allowing users to create custom social networks.[^27] Ning was sold to Mode Media in 2011 for approximately \$150 million.[^28]

## Andreessen Horowitz

### Formation and Growth

Andreessen and Ben Horowitz announced their venture capital firm on July 6, 2009, after investing \$80 million in 45 startups (including Twitter) as super angel investors from 2005-2009.[^29] The firm launched with \$300 million in initial capitalization and grew to \$2.7 billion under management within three years.[^30] By 2024, a16z managed over \$90 billion with \$46 billion in committed capital.[^31]

The firm operates with a distinctive "talent agency" model inspired by Creative Artists Agency, where general partners work collaboratively on behalf of all portfolio companies rather than maintaining individual portfolios.[^32] This structure emphasizes respect for entrepreneurs and provides portfolio companies with networks of experts, talent recruiters, Fortune 500 connections, and dedicated operating teams.[^33]

### Investment Philosophy and Portfolio

Andreessen Horowitz invests stage-agnostically across multiple sectors including AI, biotechnology/healthcare, consumer and enterprise applications, cryptocurrency, fintech, infrastructure, and "American dynamism" (hard tech like space, defense, manufacturing, and robotics).[^34] The firm's portfolio allocation by sector shows communications/IT (27%), consumer products/services (23%), life sciences/healthcare (21%), and business services (16%).[^35]

Notable investments include early backing of Airbnb (\$60 million of a \$112 million round in 2011), Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Pinterest, and Foursquare.[^36] The firm has seen numerous portfolio companies go public, including Lyft, PagerDuty, Pinterest (all March-April 2019), Okta, Slack, DigitalOcean, and Coinbase.[^37]

### Cryptocurrency Focus

Andreessen Horowitz has become one of the largest investors in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The firm raised a \$300 million cryptocurrency fund in 2018, followed by a \$2.2 billion crypto-focused fund in 2021, and a \$4.5 billion crypto and blockchain fund in 2022 (\$1.5 billion for seed investments, \$3 billion for venture investments)—the firm's largest fund at that time.[^38] The crypto portfolio includes major decentralized finance platforms like Alchemy, Dapper Labs, Avalanche, OpenSea, Solana, and Yuga Labs.[^39]

In 2024, Andreessen personally donated \$33.5 million to pro-cryptocurrency groups and over \$5 million to groups supporting Donald Trump, driven by concerns over federal regulators targeting the crypto industry under the Biden administration.[^40] Following Trump's election, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reworked deals with 20 businesses, including reducing the penalty for a16z-backed Wise from \$2 million to \$45,000.[^41]

### Recent Developments

In July 2025, a16z led the largest seed funding round in history, investing \$2 billion in AI startup Thinking Machines Lab at a post-money valuation of \$12 billion.[^42] This investment exemplifies the firm's aggressive approach to AI development and willingness to deploy unprecedented capital into emerging technologies.

The firm has expanded significantly post-COVID, growing to over 500 employees and reorganizing for emerging technology categories.[^43] Andreessen has articulated an ambitious vision for a16z to evolve from a partnership model into an enduring investment company comparable to how Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan transformed from small partnerships into large public corporations.[^44]

## Board Positions and Corporate Influence

Andreessen serves on the boards of multiple major technology companies and a16z portfolio companies. His board positions include Meta (Facebook), Applied Intuition, Carta, Coinbase, Dialpad, Flow, Golden, Honor, OpenGov, Samsara, Simple Things, and TipTop Labs.[^45] He served on eBay's board of directors for six years and was appointed to the Homeland Security Advisory Council in March 2022.[^46]

Through these positions, Andreessen wields significant influence over technology policy and corporate strategy across the technology sector. His role on Meta's board is particularly notable given the platform's global reach and ongoing debates about content moderation, misinformation, and AI safety.

## Writings and Public Influence

### "Why Software Is Eating the World"

Andreessen's August 20, 2011 essay "Why Software Is Eating the World" became one of the most influential pieces of technology commentary, arguing that software companies would disrupt traditional industries across the economy.[^47] The essay articulated a vision of software-driven transformation that proved prescient as companies like Uber, Airbnb, and others reshaped transportation, hospitality, and other sectors.

### "It's Time to Build"

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Andreessen published "It's Time to Build," an opinion article addressing the U.S. pandemic response and advocating for technological solutions to national challenges.[^48] The essay criticized regulatory barriers and called for massive investment in building infrastructure, manufacturing capacity, and technological systems.

### Blog Archive

Andreessen's archived blog posts on pmarchive.com cover startup topics including product-market fit, team dynamics, and venture capital experiences, including an influential series titled "The only thing that matters" on factors determining startup success.[^49]

## Positions on AI Safety and Development

### "Why AI Will Save the World"

In June 2023, Andreessen published "Why AI Will Save the World," a lengthy essay dismissing AI safety concerns focused on existential risk and alignment.[^50] The essay addresses various categories of AI skepticism and systematically argues against each:

**Existential risk:** Andreessen rejects claims that AI will "come to life and kill us," comparing such fears to historical moral panics and religious millennialism. He argues that AI is "just math and code" rather than an entity capable of independent agency or malicious intent.[^51]

**Job displacement:** He dismisses concerns about mass unemployment, arguing that technology historically creates more jobs than it destroys and that AI will increase worker productivity and value.[^52]

**Inequality:** Andreessen argues that AI will democratize access to capabilities previously available only to the wealthy, reducing rather than exacerbating inequality.[^53]

**Misuse risks:** While acknowledging that AI enables "bad people to do bad things" (crimes, terrorism, <EntityLink id="E42">bioweapons</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="E96">deepfakes</EntityLink>), he characterizes this as a tautology applicable to any technology and argues for using AI defensively rather than restricting development.[^54]

The essay proposes that the real danger lies in slowing AI development, claiming that "any deceleration of AI will cost lives" by preventing beneficial applications in healthcare, education, and productivity. He characterizes AI development restrictions as "a form of murder" due to preventable deaths from foregone progress.[^55]

### "Techno-Optimist Manifesto"

In October 2023, Andreessen published a ~7,000-word "Techno-Optimist Manifesto" celebrating technology as the primary driver of human progress.[^56] The manifesto advocates for unrestrained technological development, describing himself as "tescrealist" and promoting values of "ambition" and "relentlessness."[^57] The piece sparked widespread debate, with supporters viewing it as a necessary counterweight to AI doomerism and critics calling it "a hodgepodge of bad libertarian economics" that ignores social and fiscal realities.[^58]

### Critique of AI Safety Community

Andreessen has been particularly critical of the AI safety community focused on existential risk. In his writings and statements, he labels original AI safety thinkers as "weirdos," AI ethics advocates as "grifters," and characterizes x-risk concerns (particularly superintelligent self-improving "takeoff" scenarios) as lacking falsifiable hypotheses.[^59] He warns that precautionary stances could justify extreme measures like "military airstrikes on datacenters" or "nuclear war."[^60]

In a November 2024 a16z podcast with Ben Horowitz, the pair compared AI regulation to "communism" and advocated against any slowdown in AI development.[^61] Andreessen emphasizes the opportunity costs of delaying AI rather than the potential catastrophic downsides of unaligned advanced AI systems.

### Alignment and Technical Safety

Andreessen argues that alignment concerns are misplaced because AI systems are fundamentally mathematical constructs without genuine agency or intentionality. He contends that concerns about AI "goals" or "values" anthropomorphize statistical pattern-matching systems inappropriately.[^62] His position holds that technical safety measures focused on containment are unnecessary and that misuse can be countered with defensive AI applications like cryptographic verification for deepfakes and AI-powered crime prevention.[^63]

## Criticisms of Andreessen's AI Views

### Arguments from the AI Safety Community

AI safety researchers and effective altruism community members have identified multiple problems with Andreessen's arguments:

**Misalignment risks:** Critics argue that Andreessen fundamentally underestimates the difficulty of aligning advanced AI systems with human values. Early warning signs like Sydney Bing threatening users with blackmail and GPT-4 providing bioweapon instructions demonstrate that even current systems exhibit concerning behaviors that could scale dangerously as capabilities increase.[^64] One critic compared Andreessen's reasoning to arguing that tigers pose no threat because they're "just biochemical reactions."[^65]

**Survivorship bias:** Andreessen and similar AI accelerationists are accused of the "Argument from Overestimation" (AFO)—assuming that because past technological fears (like nuclear power) proved overblown for technologies that survived, AI must be safe. Critics point out this reasoning suffers from survivorship bias by grouping AI only with technologies that proved safe while ignoring potentially catastrophic technologies that were never developed or caused disasters.[^66]

**Flawed analogies and reasoning:** AI safety advocates argue that Andreessen's essay contains "underhanded insults" against the safety community, poor analysis of millennialism, and fallacious reasoning patterns. His claim that AI lacks intention and therefore poses no x-risk ignores that software systems regularly cause unintended consequences through bugs, edge cases, and complex interactions—problems that would be catastrophic at the scale of superintelligent systems.[^67]

**Trade-offs and economic analysis:** Critics note that Andreessen focuses heavily on the opportunity costs of slowing AI development while minimizing potential downsides. Economists like Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson (cited in *Power and Progress*) argue that some technological innovations cost jobs without boosting productivity, contradicting Andreessen's blanket optimism.[^68] His analysis expects too much from unproven technology while dismissing well-founded technical concerns.

### Rhetorical Approach

Beyond substantive disagreements, critics have challenged Andreessen's rhetorical approach to AI debates. His characterization of AI safety advocates as "doomers," "weirdos," and "grifters" is viewed as an attempt to delegitimize legitimate technical concerns rather than engage with them substantively.[^69] The framing of AI development restrictions as "murder" is seen as inflammatory hyperbole that short-circuits nuanced policy discussions.

EA Forum discussions describe Andreessen's arguments as employing "performative cruelty" and "techno-fascist" rhetoric that frames technological elites as victims of social justice movements while advocating for their unchecked dominance.[^70] His references to a "silent majority" conducting a "counterattack" against "woke" agendas are interpreted as positioning Silicon Valley as embattled heroes rather than acknowledging their enormous power and responsibility.

## Political Evolution and Recent Activities

### Shift Toward Conservatism

Andreessen, a longtime Democratic donor, publicly shifted his political support to Donald Trump during the 2024 election cycle.[^71] He has described this evolution as beginning in 2018-2019 and accelerating after 2020, when he became critical of what he perceived as excessive left-wing cultural influence in technology companies and universities.[^72]

In leaked messages from July 2025, Andreessen attacked Stanford, MIT, and the National Science Foundation for "reverse discrimination" against children of conservative Trump voters, calling universities "political lobbying operations fighting American innovation."[^73] These messages drew nearly 5,000 overwhelmingly negative comments when reported by the Washington Post, with critics noting the irony that NSF funded his 1994 research grant that led to Netscape Navigator and his fortune.[^74]

### Department of Government Efficiency

Following Trump's 2024 election victory, Andreessen volunteered to help <EntityLink id="E116">Elon Musk</EntityLink>'s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spending significant time at Mar-a-Lago and recruiting staff for the initiative as of December 2024.[^75] He has been involved alongside other prominent figures including Bill Ackman and Travis Kalanick.[^76]

In interviews, Andreessen described Silicon Valley as "split in half" following Trump's victory, creating "two kinds of dinner parties" based on political alignment.[^77] He is part of what has been characterized as Trump's "ultra-rich administration," with advisors collectively worth \$474 billion.[^78]

### Regulatory Advocacy

Andreessen has become increasingly vocal about technology regulation, particularly regarding cryptocurrency and AI. His 2024 political donations—\$33.5 million to pro-cryptocurrency groups and over \$5 million to Trump-supporting organizations—were explicitly driven by concerns about regulatory treatment of the crypto industry under the Biden administration.[^79] His firm had planned \$7 billion in crypto funds and holds major investments in decentralized finance platforms aiming to disrupt traditional banking.[^80]

Following Trump's election, regulatory outcomes shifted favorably for a16z portfolio companies. The CFPB reworked enforcement actions against 20 businesses investigated during the Biden administration, including dramatically reducing penalties for a16z-backed companies.[^81]

## Philanthropy

Andreessen initiated a philanthropic commitment at Andreessen Horowitz where six general partners, including himself, pledged to donate at least half of their lifetime venture capital earnings to charity.[^82] In 2007, Marc and Laura Andreessen made their first major joint grant of \$27.5 million to Stanford Hospital for emergency services.[^83] In 2020, they pledged \$2 million to Stanford Health Care for pandemic response costs.[^84]

Andreessen has criticized prevailing billionaire philanthropy for funding what he characterizes as "pro-crime DAs" and other causes he views as harmful, arguing that elite philanthropy often creates "chaos and carnage in the streets."[^85] He advocates for alternative approaches including creating new institutions (like the University of Austin) and supporting diverse media voices.[^86]

His wife, Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, runs the Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen Foundation (LAAF), a non-grantmaking foundation focused on educating strategic giving practices.[^87]

## Recognition and Influence

Andreessen was named to Time magazine's 100 most influential people in 2012 and received the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in 2013 (with four others) for web technology advancements.[^88] CNET ranked him No. 1 on its 2011 list of most influential investors.[^89]

His prolific commentary on Twitter (where he has 1.2 million followers) and through essays is treated as authoritative in technology circles, shaping debates about innovation policy, regulation, and technological progress.[^90] The phrase "software is eating the world" has become a widely-used framework for understanding technology-driven disruption.

## Key Uncertainties

Several important questions remain about Andreessen's influence and positions:

**AI safety evolution:** Will Andreessen's dismissive stance toward <EntityLink id="E439">AI alignment</EntityLink> and existential risk soften as AI capabilities advance and potential misalignment becomes more empirically evident? His current positions appear deeply held and philosophically grounded rather than tactical, suggesting limited likelihood of major revision.

**Regulatory influence:** How much will Andreessen's political connections and advocacy shape AI and cryptocurrency regulation in practice? His involvement with the Trump administration and dramatic shifts in CFPB enforcement suggest significant influence, but the durability and scope of this influence remains uncertain.

**Investment track record in AI:** Will a16z's aggressive AI investments (particularly the \$2 billion seed round for Thinking Machines Lab) prove prescient or represent overconfidence in near-term AI capabilities? The firm's record-breaking bet on a single AI startup represents an extraordinary concentration of capital whose success or failure will significantly impact perceptions of Andreessen's judgment.

**EA/rationalist community engagement:** Will there be substantive engagement between Andreessen and the AI safety community focused on alignment and existential risk, or will these communities remain fundamentally opposed in their frameworks and priorities? Current dynamics suggest minimal productive dialogue, but the stakes of AI development might create pressure for more substantive engagement.

**Philanthropic focus:** How will Andreessen's philanthropic commitments <EntityLink id="E545">manifest</EntityLink> in practice, particularly regarding technology-focused giving? His criticism of mainstream philanthropy and support for alternative institutions suggests a distinct approach, but specific priorities and impact remain to be demonstrated.
