## Overview

Sam Bankman-Fried (commonly known as "SBF") is an American entrepreneur and convicted fraudster who founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX in 2019 and the quantitative trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. At his peak, he was estimated to be worth approximately \$26.5 billion and was celebrated both as a transformative figure in cryptocurrency and as a prominent practitioner of <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>-aligned "earning to give" philanthropy.[^1] Forbes included him on its 2021 "30 Under 30" list and later, with bitter irony, on its 2023 "Hall of Shame."[^1]

In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy after revelations that Bankman-Fried had been directing customer deposits to Alameda Research without disclosure, leaving an estimated \$8–9 billion shortfall in customer funds.[^4] The collapse erased an estimated \$1 trillion from cryptocurrency markets.[^5] Bankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022, convicted on all seven counts of fraud and money laundering in November 2023 following roughly four hours of jury deliberation, and sentenced in March 2024 to 25 years in federal prison.[^3] Prosecutors described the case as one of the largest financial crimes in U.S. history.[^6]

Beyond the immediate financial wreckage, Bankman-Fried's collapse had significant ramifications for the <EntityLink id="E517">effective altruism</EntityLink> community, which had celebrated him as a model donor, and prompted renewed debate about whether effective altruism's emphasis on expected-value reasoning had enabled or encouraged his risk-taking. His FTX Future Fund had planned to distribute \$100 million in 2022 toward AI safety, pandemic prevention, and other EA-priority causes before the collapse rendered those commitments void.[^7]

## Early Life and Professional Beginnings

Bankman-Fried was born on March 6, 1992, in Stanford, California, to Barbara Fried and Joe Bankman, both academics.[^8] He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and later MIT, where he developed interests in mathematics and finance.[^1] After graduating, he worked as a trader on the international ETF desk at Jane Street Capital, where he developed expertise in automated trading systems.[^1]

In 2017, Bankman-Fried left Jane Street and briefly joined the <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>, where he began identifying arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin trading across exchanges.[^8] He co-founded Alameda Research in late 2017, initially operating out of a basement with five or six colleagues. The firm exploited price discrepancies in Bitcoin between exchanges—most notably between Japan and the United States, moving as much as \$25 million daily—and at peak generated up to \$1 million per day in profit before price differences narrowed.[^8][^9] Initial funding came in part from Jaan Tallinn and Luke Ding; Bankman-Fried came to own approximately 90% of Alameda by 2021.[^1]

Alameda's early success created both the capital and the credibility for Bankman-Fried's next venture. However, the firm was not without internal controversy: co-founder Tara Mac Aulay and other early employees departed citing concerns about risk management and ethics, warnings that would later prove prescient.[^10]

## FTX: Rise and Collapse

### Founding and Growth

In April 2019, Bankman-Fried co-founded FTX Trading Ltd. in Hong Kong as a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. FTX distinguished itself with user-friendly tools, leveraged trading, futures contracts, and a native token—FTT—that offered trading discounts to holders.[^8] Alameda Research served as FTX's primary market maker and held large quantities of FTT, creating deep structural entanglement between the exchange and the trading firm.[^9]

FTX grew rapidly, relocating to the Bahamas in 2021 to take advantage of a more permissive regulatory environment.[^8] The exchange was valued at \$25 billion in October 2021 with investment from major institutions including Temasek, Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital, and BlackRock.[^11] By early 2022 it carried a \$32 billion valuation.[^4] FTX acquired LedgerX, a U.S.-regulated derivatives exchange, for \$300 million in 2021, and signed a \$135 million naming-rights deal for the Miami Heat's NBA arena.[^1] Celebrity endorsements from Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen, Steph Curry, and a prominent Super Bowl advertisement featuring Larry David reinforced FTX's public profile.[^8]

Bankman-Fried became a prominent Washington presence during this period, testifying before Congress on cryptocurrency regulation and making significant political donations—reportedly \$5.2 million to a pro-Biden committee in 2020 and hundreds of millions more across the political spectrum, including alleged use of \$100 million in FTX customer funds for 2022 U.S. election contributions.[^5][^12] He was described by some commentators as the "J.P. Morgan of crypto."[^5]

### The Structural Problem

Underlying FTX's public success was a dangerous and undisclosed arrangement. According to the SEC's charges and subsequent trial evidence, Bankman-Fried had provided Alameda Research with a virtually unlimited line of credit funded by FTX customer deposits, and had exempted Alameda from the risk management controls applied to other traders on the platform.[^12] Alameda held large positions in FTT and other illiquid assets, making the entire structure dependent on FTT maintaining its value.

FTX operated under essentially no meaningful governance. John Ray, the bankruptcy administrator who also oversaw Enron's collapse, described the situation as stemming from "the absolute concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controls that are necessary for a company that is entrusted with other people's money."[^13] FTX used QuickBooks rather than enterprise-grade accounting software, had no independent board of directors, and had a corporate structure spanning approximately 100 affiliated entities with unclear asset locations and employee records.[^13][^14]

Brett Harrison, former CEO of FTX US, later described Bankman-Fried as someone who responded to challenge with what Harrison characterized as dysregulated hostility, gaslighting, and manipulation, and who treated experienced professionals' judgment as irrelevant.[^15]

### Collapse

In November 2022, reporting on Alameda's balance sheet—which showed that a large portion of its assets consisted of FTT tokens—triggered a crisis of confidence. A withdrawal run on FTX exposed the underlying insolvency. On November 6, 2022, Bankman-Fried created an internal document stating FTX had enough to process only a fraction of remaining client asset requests; by November 7, he estimated a \$3.9 billion asset base against an \$8.1 billion shortfall in customer liabilities.[^4] FTX filed for bankruptcy with less than \$1 billion in liquid assets against \$9 billion in liabilities.[^1] Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO and was replaced by John Ray.[^8]

An independent examiner subsequently found that many FTX investments had involved limited due diligence and were based on unsupported valuations.[^16] Prosecution expert Professor Peter Easton testified at trial that customer funds had been diverted to Bahamian real estate (including a \$30 million penthouse for Bankman-Fried), crypto startups, and political contributions.[^4]

## Trial and Sentencing

Bankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 and extradited to the United States. His trial began in 2023. Key witnesses against him included Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research and Bankman-Fried's ex-girlfriend, and Adam Yedidia, a former MIT acquaintance and FTX employee, both of whom testified for the prosecution after pleading guilty to related charges.[^17]

Bankman-Fried chose to testify in his own defense, a decision widely regarded as damaging. His cross-examination exposed numerous contradictions with prior public statements, and his testimony was largely dismantled by the prosecution.[^17] The jury deliberated for approximately four hours before returning guilty verdicts on all seven counts of wire fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering.[^2]

On March 28, 2024, Judge Lewis Kaplan sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in federal prison and ordered \$11 billion in forfeiture.[^3] The judge noted that Bankman-Fried had not expressed substantial remorse.[^6] Bankman-Fried has maintained that he did not commit fraud, and filed an appeal of his conviction in September 2024.[^18]

By October 2025, bankruptcy CEO John Ray had recovered at least \$16 billion in assets for the FTX estate, aided in part by surging cryptocurrency prices and the sale of assets including LedgerX.[^16] Ray has characterized Bankman-Fried's claims of FTX solvency as categorically false.[^16]

## Effective Altruism and AI Safety Involvement

Bankman-Fried was a prominent and influential figure in the <EntityLink id="E517">effective altruism</EntityLink> community before his arrest. He joined Giving What We Can in 2016, signed the Giving Pledge in 2022, donated half his salary to charity in his early career, and built his entire public entrepreneurial narrative around the "earning to give" framework—the idea that maximizing income and donating the proceeds could produce more good than direct charitable work.[^1]

Through the FTX Foundation's Future Fund, Bankman-Fried planned to distribute \$100 million in 2022 toward AI safety, pandemic risk reduction, and other EA-priority causes.[^7][^25] EA community leaders including William MacAskill had mentored him and publicly amplified his philosophy of large-scale expected-value reasoning and risk tolerance.[^19] EA forums celebrated his approach, including his reasoning for launching FTX even after Alameda's success—framed as maximizing expected value by pursuing a larger platform.[^19]

On AI safety specifically, Bankman-Fried viewed preventing risks from misaligned artificial general intelligence as a priority cause, consistent with the EA community's emphasis on long-term existential risks. His fund explicitly targeted AI safety as part of its portfolio alongside pandemic preparedness.[^7]

### Impact on the EA Community

The FTX collapse produced immediate and significant damage to EA's reputation. William MacAskill publicly disavowed Bankman-Fried following the collapse, estimating at the time that there was approximately a 20% chance the EA movement would not recover.[^19] Rob Wiblin and other prominent EA figures similarly distanced themselves publicly.[^19] The FTX Future Fund's board resigned en masse.

On <EntityLink id="E538">LessWrong</EntityLink>, the community response was characterized by clear condemnation of fraud committed in the name of effective altruism, with posts explicitly rejecting the notion that fraud could be justified by altruistic ends.[^20] EA Forum discussions reflected substantial self-criticism, with posters questioning whether the community's emphasis on expected-value maximization and linear utility in money had validated or encouraged Bankman-Fried's willingness to take catastrophic risks, and regretting that early warning signs—including high employee turnover at Alameda and explicit concerns raised by figures such as Oliver Habryka—had been dismissed.[^19][^21]

External critics went further, arguing that EA's deference to wealthy donors, including Bankman-Fried's \$160 million in commitments and Dustin Moskovitz's \$440 million or more, had compromised the movement's intellectual honesty and moral independence.[^22]

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Fraud and Governance Failures

The core criminal findings against Bankman-Fried are that he misappropriated billions in FTX customer deposits, channeled them to Alameda Research without disclosure, and used those funds for personal enrichment, political donations, and speculative investments. The jury found these facts proven beyond reasonable doubt on all counts.

Independent of the fraud itself, the governance failures at FTX were exceptional in scale. John Ray's assessment—drawing on his experience with Enron—characterized FTX's collapse as among the worst examples of corporate control failures he had encountered.[^13] The absence of basic accounting controls, independent oversight, or professional risk management at a company entrusted with billions in customer assets represented a systemic failure enabled by Bankman-Fried's concentration of authority and dismissal of experienced advisors.[^13][^15]

### Expected Value Reasoning and EA

Several critics have argued that the specific philosophical framework Bankman-Fried embraced—EA-influenced expected-value maximization with linear (rather than logarithmic) utility for money—provided both the motivation and the self-justification for his risk-taking. Under such reasoning, a sufficiently positive expected outcome can justify actions that most ethical frameworks would prohibit, including accepting catastrophic downside risks.[^23] Scott Aaronson, among others, has observed that Bankman-Fried's errors may have stemmed from a genuine but catastrophically misapplied commitment to expected-value reasoning—treating the possibility of funding world-saving causes as justifying unlimited financial risk-taking—rather than from simple greed.[^23]

Others have noted that the money-focused environment at Alameda and FTX may itself have eroded ethical reasoning among those involved, consistent with research on how financial incentives can crowd out moral judgment.[^24]

### EA's "Moral Equilibrium" Problem

A recurring critique in post-FTX analysis is that EA's framework enabled a form of "moral equilibrium" in which Bankman-Fried treated his philanthropic ambitions as offsetting or justifying fraud. Critics note that the mathematical structure of EA—maximizing expected good across possible outcomes—is susceptible to motivated reasoning when the individual doing the calculation stands to benefit, particularly absent institutional checks.[^24] Defenders of EA counter that SBF's actions were not representative of core EA empiricism or consequentialism, and that thousands of EA practitioners have not committed fraud.[^19]

### Lack of Remorse

Judge Kaplan's sentencing comments noted that Bankman-Fried had not expressed substantial remorse for his actions.[^6] Bankman-Fried has continued to claim he did not commit fraud and to assert that FTX was solvent at the time of its collapse—a claim John Ray has explicitly rejected.[^16]

## Recent Developments

Bankman-Fried is serving his sentence at a federal correctional facility. News reports indicate he was transferred to a low-security facility in California by early 2025.[^18] He has filed an appeal of his conviction, in part alleging that Judge Kaplan improperly excluded evidence that could have supported a good-faith reliance defense.[^18]

News reports have also indicated that Bankman-Fried and his family explored the possibility of a presidential pardon, citing Donald Trump's stated interest in pro-crypto policy, though Trump reportedly stated he had no intention of granting clemency.[^18] Reports indicate that Bankman-Fried has become active as an informal legal advisor to other high-profile inmates.[^26]

The FTX bankruptcy estate, administered by John Ray, had recovered at least \$16 billion by October 2025, exceeding initial expectations substantially, in part because cryptocurrency prices rose sharply after the bankruptcy filing.[^16]

Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried's former co-conspirator and Alameda CEO, was sentenced to two years in prison on September 24, 2024.[^18]

## Key Uncertainties

- **Appeal outcome**: Bankman-Fried's appeal, which raises evidentiary objections to Judge Kaplan's rulings, was pending as of late 2025. The Second Circuit had previously vacated convictions in a separate Kaplan case on related grounds.[^18]
- **Long-term EA impact**: The extent to which the FTX collapse durably affects the effective altruism movement's funding, reputation, and philosophical development remains contested and unclear.[^19]
- **AI safety funding gap**: The collapse of FTX Future Fund created a significant anticipated gap in AI safety and biosecurity funding that had been planned for 2022–2023. The degree to which this gap was filled by other funders is not fully documented in available sources.
- **Motivations**: Whether Bankman-Fried's actions were primarily motivated by greed, by self-serving application of expected-value reasoning, by genuine belief that ends justified means, or by some combination, remains genuinely debated among analysts.[^23][^24]
