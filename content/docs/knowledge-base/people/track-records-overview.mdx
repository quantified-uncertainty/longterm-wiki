This section documents the epistemic track records of influential figures in AI. Understanding where experts have been right or wrong—and their patterns of over/underconfidence—helps calibrate how much weight to give their current views.

## Available Track Records

| Person | Summary | Key Pattern |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| <EntityLink id="yann-lecun-predictions">Yann LeCun</EntityLink> | Strong on long-term architectural intuitions; underestimates near-term LLM capabilities | Consistent skeptic |
| <EntityLink id="sam-altman-predictions">Sam Altman</EntityLink> | Directionally correct on AI trajectory; overoptimistic on specific timelines | Safety rhetoric vs. deployment tension |
| <EntityLink id="eliezer-yudkowsky-predictions">Eliezer Yudkowsky</EntityLink> | Early timeline errors; vindicated on AI generalization; core doom predictions unfalsifiable | Updated from early overconfidence |
| <EntityLink id="elon-musk-predictions">Elon Musk</EntityLink> | Prescient safety warnings; consistently missed product timelines by 6+ years | Shifting goalposts |

## Methodology

Each track record page documents:

1. **Resolved predictions** - Claims that can now be evaluated with ✅/❌/⚠️ status
2. **Pending predictions** - Testable claims with target dates
3. **Unfalsifiable claims** - Positions that cannot be empirically tested
4. **Accuracy analysis** - Patterns of where the person is right/wrong
5. **Position evolution** - How their views have changed over time

All claims include source citations where available.
