## Overview

Holden Karnofsky was co-CEO of <R id="dd0cf0ff290cc68e"><EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink></R> (formerly <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>), the most influential grantmaker in AI safety and existential risk. Through Coefficient, he directed over \$100 million toward AI safety research and governance, fundamentally transforming it from a fringe academic interest into a well-funded field with hundreds of researchers. In 2025, he joined Anthropic.

His strategic thinking has shaped how the effective altruism community prioritizes AI risk through frameworks like the <R id="1a20dfc897a0933a">"Most Important Century"</R> thesis. This argues we may live in the century that determines humanity's entire future trajectory due to transformative AI development.

| Funding Achievement | Amount | Impact |
|-------------------|---------|---------|
| Total AI safety grants | \$300M+ | Enabled field growth from ~dozens to hundreds of researchers |
| Anthropic investment | \$580M+ | Created major safety-focused AI lab |
| Field building grants | \$50M+ | Established academic programs and research infrastructure |

- 2023: Expanded governance funding addressing AI regulation

## Strategic Frameworks and Intellectual Contributions

### The "Most Important Century" Thesis

**Core argument structure:**

| Component | Claim | Implication |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Technology potential | Transformative AI possible this century | Could exceed agricultural/industrial revolution impacts |
| Speed differential | AI transition faster than historical precedents | Less time to adapt and coordinate |
| Leverage moment | Our actions now shape outcomes | Unlike past revolutions where individuals had little influence |
| Conclusion | This century uniquely important | Justifies enormous current investment |

**Supporting evidence:**
- <R id="62d29d310d596d2a">Biological anchors methodology</R> for AI timelines
- Historical analysis of technological transitions
- Economic modeling of AI impact potential

### Bio Anchors Framework

Developed with <R id="63739057bf3d421b">Ajeya Cotra</R>, this framework estimates AI development timelines by comparing required computation to biological systems:

| Anchor Type | Computation Estimate | Timeline Implication |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Human brain | ≈10^15 FLOP/s | Medium-term (2030s-2040s) |
| Human lifetime | ≈10^24 FLOP | Longer-term (2040s-2050s) |
| Evolution | ≈10^41 FLOP | Much longer-term if needed |

## Coefficient Giving Funding Strategy

### Portfolio Approach

| Research Area | Funding Focus | Key Recipients | Rationale |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Technical alignment | \$100M+ | <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="redwood-research">Redwood Research</EntityLink> | Direct work on making AI systems safer |
| <EntityLink id="ai-governance">AI governance</EntityLink> | \$80M+ | <R id="f0d95954b449240a"><EntityLink id="cset">Center for Security and Emerging Technology</EntityLink></R>, policy fellowships | Institutional responses to AI development |
| Field building | \$50M+ | University programs, individual researchers | Growing research community |
| Compute governance | \$20M+ | <EntityLink id="monitoring">Compute monitoring research</EntityLink> | Oversight of AI development resources |

### Grantmaking Philosophy

**Key principles:**
- **Hits-based giving**: Expect most grants to have limited impact, few to be transformative
- **Long time horizons**: Patient capital for 5-10 year research projects  
- **Active partnership**: Strategic guidance beyond just funding
- **Portfolio diversification**: Multiple approaches given uncertainty

**Notable funding decisions:**
- <R id="27ce8f3b89dcdaa1">Anthropic investment</R>: \$580M to create safety-focused competitor to OpenAI
- <EntityLink id="miri">MIRI funding</EntityLink>: Early support for foundational <EntityLink id="alignment">AI alignment</EntityLink> research
- Policy fellowships: Placing AI safety researchers in government positions

## Current Views and Assessment

### Karnofsky's AI Risk Timeline

Based on public statements and Coefficient Giving priorities from 2023-2024, Karnofsky's views reflect a combination of timeline estimates derived from technical forecasting and strategic assessments about field readiness and policy urgency:

| Expert/Source | Estimate | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Transformative AI (2022) | 15% by 2036, 50% by 2060 | Derived from the bio anchors framework developed with Ajeya Cotra, which estimates AI development timelines by comparing required computation to biological systems. This central estimate suggests transformative AI is more likely than not within this century, though substantial uncertainty remains around both shorter and longer timelines. |
| Field adequacy (2024) | Still severely underfunded | Despite directing over \$100M toward AI safety and growing the field from approximately 20 to 400+ FTE researchers, Coefficient Giving continues aggressive hiring and grantmaking. This assessment reflects the belief that the scale of the challenge—ensuring safe development of transformative AI—far exceeds current resources and talent devoted to it. |
| Policy urgency (2024) | High priority | Coefficient has significantly increased governance focus, funding policy research, placing fellows in government positions, and supporting regulatory frameworks. This shift recognizes that technical alignment work alone is insufficient—institutional and policy responses are critical to managing AI development trajectories and preventing <EntityLink id="racing-dynamics">racing dynamics</EntityLink>. |

### Evolution of Views (2020-2024)

| Year | Key Update | Reasoning |
|------|------------|-----------|
| 2021 | "Most Important Century" series | Crystallized long-term strategic thinking |
| 2022 | Increased policy focus | Recognition of need for governance alongside technical work |
| 2023 | Anthropic model success | Validation of safety-focused lab approach |
| 2024 | Accelerated timelines concern | <R id="b80187df7777104d">Shorter timelines than bio anchors suggested</R> |
