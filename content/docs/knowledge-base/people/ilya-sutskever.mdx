## The Shift to Safety

### Timeline of Evolution

**Early OpenAI (2015-2019):**
- Focused on building AGI safely
- Led capabilities research
- Believed alignment would be solvable alongside capabilities

**Growing Concern (2020-2022):**
- Increasingly worried about alignment difficulty
- Private concerns about pace of development
- Pushing internally for more safety focus

**Superalignment (2023):**
- Co-led Superalignment team with <EntityLink id="jan-leike">Jan Leike</EntityLink>
- Secured 20% of compute for alignment research
- More explicit about safety prioritization

**OpenAI Departure and SSI (2024):**
- Left OpenAI in May 2024
- Founded Safe Superintelligence Inc. with singular focus
- Explicitly prioritizing safety over commercialization

### The OpenAI Board Incident (November 2023)

Sutskever was central to the brief removal of <EntityLink id="sam-altman">Sam Altman</EntityLink> as OpenAI CEO:
- Voted to remove Altman citing safety concerns
- Later expressed regret and signed letter supporting Altman's return
- Incident revealed deep tensions about safety vs. commercialization

This episode highlighted his internal struggle between capability advancement and safety.

## Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI)

### Mission

Founded June 2024 with Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy, SSI's stated mission:
- Build safe superintelligence as first priority
- Safety and capabilities advanced together
- No distraction from commercial pressures
- Insulated from short-term incentives

### Approach

**SSI's philosophy:**
1. Safety cannot be an afterthought
2. Need revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs
3. Pure focus without commercial distraction
4. Long time horizons
5. Build once, build right

### Why Leave OpenAI

While not stated explicitly, timing and circumstances suggest:
- Disagreement with OpenAI's commercialization
- Concern about safety being deprioritized
- Desire for environment purely focused on safe superintelligence
- Jan Leike's similar departure reinforced decision

## Views on AI Safety

### Sutskever's Strategic Priorities

Based on his actions and public statements surrounding the founding of Safe Superintelligence Inc., Sutskever's priorities and beliefs about AI safety can be inferred across several key dimensions.

| Expert/Source | Estimate | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| <EntityLink id="agi-timeline">AGI timeline</EntityLink> | Near-term enough to be urgent | Sutskever founded a company in 2024 specifically dedicated to building safe superintelligence, indicating he believes the timeline is short enough to warrant immediate, focused action. His departure from a leading AI lab to start a safety-focused company suggests he views superintelligence as an imminent challenge rather than a distant theoretical concern. |
| Safety priority | Absolute priority | His decision to leave OpenAI—where he was Chief Scientist and deeply embedded in cutting-edge capabilities research—to focus purely on safety demonstrates an uncompromising commitment. The SSI mission explicitly prioritizes safety over commercialization, suggesting he believes safety cannot be treated as a secondary consideration or solved after deployment. |
| Technical approach | Revolutionary breakthroughs needed | In SSI's founding announcement, Sutskever stated that solving safe superintelligence requires "revolutionary engineering and scientific breakthroughs" rather than incremental improvements to existing techniques. This indicates he believes current alignment approaches are fundamentally insufficient and that novel technical solutions must be developed from first principles. |

### Core Beliefs

1. **Superintelligence is coming**: Soon enough that dedicated effort is urgent
2. **Safety must come first**: Cannot be solved after the fact
3. **Current approaches insufficient**: Need fundamental breakthroughs
4. **Commercial pressure is harmful**: Distraction from true goal
5. **Both capabilities and safety require work**: Cannot ignore either

### Strategic Position

Sutskever's approach is unique:
- Not slowing down capabilities research
- Not racing without safety
- Building both together from scratch
- Long time horizon despite urgency
- Focused on one goal only

## Technical Perspective on Safety

### What Makes Him Different

Sutskever brings deep technical understanding:
- Built the systems everyone is worried about
- Understands capabilities trajectory firsthand
- Knows what future systems might be capable of
- Can assess technical proposals realistically

### His Likely Concerns

Based on his background and decisions:
- **<EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment">Deceptive alignment</EntityLink>**: Sufficiently capable systems hiding true objectives
- **Rapid capability jumps**: Having seen <EntityLink id="emergent-capabilities">emergent capabilities</EntityLink>, knows they can surprise
- **Inadequate oversight**: Human supervision may not scale to superintelligence
- **Inner alignment**: Ensuring learned objectives match intended objectives
- **Deployment pressure**: Commercial incentives pushing unsafe deployment

### Research Direction

While SSI hasn't published yet (as of late 2024), likely focuses:
- Interpretability at scale
- Robust alignment techniques
- <EntityLink id="scalable-oversight">Scalable oversight</EntityLink> methods
- Testing alignment properties before deployment
- Fundamental theoretical work

## Influence and Impact

- Demonstrated you can prioritize safety without abandoning capabilities
- Created template for safety-first organization

## Public Communication

Sutskever is notably private:
- Rarely gives interviews
- Minimal social media presence
- Actions speak louder than words
- Technical papers rather than blog posts

**Key public statements:**
- SSI founding announcement (June 2024)
- Occasional technical talks
- OpenAI board letter and retraction

His reticence makes his actions (leaving OpenAI, founding SSI) more significant.

## Current Focus at SSI

SSI's approach (based on public statements):

1. **Straight shot to safe superintelligence**: No detours
2. **Revolutionary breakthroughs**: In both safety and capabilities
3. **Insulated development**: Free from commercial pressure
4. **World-class team**: Recruiting top researchers
5. **Patient approach**: Right timeline, not fast timeline

- **Similar**: Safety-focused, willing to build capabilities
- **Different**: SSI even more focused (no products, no distractions)

### vs. DeepMind
- **Similar**: Large-scale technical research
- **Different**: SSI is only about superintelligence safety

### vs. Pure Safety Orgs (<EntityLink id="miri">MIRI</EntityLink>, ARC)
- **Similar**: Safety prioritized
- **Different**: SSI building systems, not just theorizing

## Significance of His Shift

Sutskever's evolution is important because:

1. **Credibility**: Can't be dismissed as not understanding AI
2. **Inside view**: Saw OpenAI from within, still left for safety
3. **Technical depth**: Knows exactly what's possible
4. **Resources**: Can attract top talent and funding
5. **Template**: Shows safety-first approach is viable

## Key Questions About SSI

**Unanswered questions:**
- Will truly avoid commercial pressures long-term?
- Can make progress without publishing?
- Is building superintelligence to solve safety the right approach?
- How will they know if they've succeeded?
- What if they get there first but haven't solved safety?

These questions matter enormously given stakes.
