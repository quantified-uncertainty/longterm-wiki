## Overview

The FTX Future Fund was a philanthropic initiative launched in February 2022 by the FTX Foundation, a charitable arm of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange. The fund was primarily financed by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, with additional contributions from executives Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh.[^1] Its stated mission was to make grants and investments in ambitious projects improving humanity's long-term prospects, with particular emphasis on areas aligned with <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>'s priorities and the broader <EntityLink id="E552">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>-adjacent longtermist funding ecosystem.

At its launch, the fund announced plans to distribute at least \$100 million in 2022 and potentially up to \$1 billion, positioning itself as a transformative new source of funding for existential risk research and related causes.[^2] It supported work on safe artificial intelligence development, catastrophic biorisk reduction, pandemic preparedness, institutional improvements, and related longtermist priorities. Within its first four months of operation, it had awarded 262 grants and investments totaling \$132 million, though reporting at the time noted uncertainty about how much of that sum had actually been disbursed.[^3]

The fund collapsed abruptly in November 2022 when FTX filed for bankruptcy following revelations that the exchange had allegedly misused customer deposits. Five senior Future Fund officials resigned on November 10, 2022, stating that it appeared likely many committed grants would go unfulfilled and citing fundamental questions about the legitimacy of the business operations funding the foundation.[^4] The collapse left numerous nonprofits and research organizations without funding they had anticipated, dealt significant reputational damage to the effective altruism movement, and prompted broader reflection about the risks of concentrating philanthropic resources in a single source tied to a for-profit enterprise.

## History

### Launch and Early Operations (February–June 2022)

The FTX Future Fund was publicly announced in early 2022, with an initial open application deadline of March 21, 2022.[^5] The fund emphasized bold and decisive grantmaking, explicitly seeking projects capable of deploying tens or hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Its priorities reflected a longtermist philosophical orientation: the fund was interested in funding initiatives that addressed risks to humanity's long-run future, including AI alignment, pandemic preparedness, and improvements to global governance and institutions.

In addition to direct grants to nonprofits and investments in for-profit organizations, the fund operated a regranting program, in which selected individuals received allocations to distribute to projects they identified independently.[^6] This structure was intended to extend the fund's reach into areas where the core team had less expertise or networks.

By June 2022, the fund had awarded 262 grants totaling \$132 million—an extraordinarily rapid pace for a newly launched philanthropic organization.[^3] Notable recipients included HelixNano (\$10 million for coronavirus vaccine research), SecureBio (\$1.2 million for pandemic early warning systems), Stanford University's Center for Innovation in Global Health (\$1.5 million), Sherlock Biosciences (\$2 million for CRISPR-based infectious disease diagnostics), and the <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink> (nearly \$14 million).[^3][^7] The fund also provided \$1.25 million to the Alignment Research Center and \$1.5 million to Cornell University for AI safety research.[^8] <EntityLink id="E557">Redwood Research</EntityLink> received funding sufficient for 18 months of operations.[^9]

### AI Safety Funding

AI safety represented one of the fund's most prominent areas of focus. Between February and August 2022, the fund awarded approximately \$32 million to AI safety projects.[^10] Beyond direct AI safety grants, FTX-affiliated funding had reportedly reached or been promised to more than 70 AI-related organizations in total, with amounts exceeding \$530 million when including broader AI-related commitments such as a reported \$500 million to <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink>.[^8] The fund's AI safety orientation reflected a broader longtermist view that risks from advanced AI systems—including the possibility of artificial general intelligence posing catastrophic dangers—warranted significant philanthropic attention.

The fund's rapid entry into AI safety funding was significant in scale: one analysis noted that if the fund had met its \$100 million annual target, longtermist giving would have grown from roughly 30% of all effective altruism donations to approximately 50%.[^11]

### The FTX Collapse and Fund Dissolution (November 2022)

On November 2, 2022, CoinDesk reported that Alameda Research—FTX's affiliated trading firm—held a large position in FTX's native FTT token, triggering a crisis of confidence in the exchange. On November 11, 2022, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and Sam Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO.[^12]

The day before the bankruptcy filing, on November 10, 2022, five senior Future Fund officials resigned in a public statement. They wrote that it appeared likely there were many committed grants that the Future Fund would be unable to honor, and that they had fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that had funded the foundation.[^4] The team stated they had been unaware of any wrongdoing and expressed that they had believed they were doing good work with legitimately earned funds.

Post-collapse investigations revealed that the fund had effectively been financed using money looted from FTX account holders, though available evidence indicated that Future Fund staff members had no knowledge that the funding source was compromised.[^13] Bankruptcy proceedings raised the possibility that creditors might seek to claw back some of the funds already distributed as grants.[^3]

Some recipient organizations distanced themselves from their FTX funding following the collapse. Stanford University, for example, removed its public announcement of the \$1.5 million grant from its Center for Innovation in Global Health.[^7]

## Structure and Operations

The fund operated through several mechanisms. It made direct grants to nonprofit organizations and individuals, and investments in for-profit organizations whose work aligned with its mission. The regranting program extended its reach further: selected regranters received allocations they could deploy to projects they identified, with latitude to fund research hires, operational expenses, or further sub-grants.[^6]

The fund described itself as moving quickly and prioritizing "massively scalable" projects—those capable of absorbing large sums without loss of effectiveness. Applications were open to both nonprofit and for-profit entities, and the fund expressed willingness to fund early-stage projects and incubate new initiatives, including building innovation ecosystems in areas like climate resilience and African blue economy sustainability.[^5]

Leadership of the fund included Nick Beckstead, a former <EntityLink id="E552">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> program officer, who served as the fund's primary leader before resigning following the FTX collapse.[^7] Will MacAskill, the Oxford philosopher closely associated with effective altruism and longtermism, served as an outside advisor to the fund and publicly stepped back from his involvement following the collapse; he was not among the five staff members who formally resigned.[^14]

## Criticisms and Concerns

### Rapid and Undiscriminating Grantmaking

Even before the FTX collapse, critics within the effective altruism community raised concerns about the fund's pace and oversight. One analysis described the fund as distributing unusually large sums without sufficient long-term evaluation, and argued that the emphasis on AI risk—premised on assumptions such as a significant probability of artificial general intelligence posing existential threats within 50 years—risked funding wasteful or counterproductive projects.[^15] The regranting program drew particular scrutiny: critics observed that regranters could receive funds for their own salaries and then make further sub-grants without strict controls, creating what was characterized as incentive structures prone to self-perpetuating "regranting chains" with limited accountability.[^15][^6]

A review of applications conducted by one grantmaker found that of 630 applications reviewed, only 37 were selected as high-quality, which critics interpreted as indicating that the fund's speed may have outpaced the supply of genuinely strong projects.[^16]

### Association with Fraud

The most severe criticism of the fund stems from its ultimate association with fraud at FTX. The FTX estate later filed lawsuits alleging that insiders had funneled funds taken from creditors toward charitable giving in ways that served reputational purposes.[^17] One employee faced a lawsuit of up to \$71.6 million over allegations of poor investment diligence.[^17] Critics argued more broadly that Sam Bankman-Fried's philanthropic profile—including his prominent association with effective altruism and the "earn to give" philosophy—had helped generate goodwill and public credibility for FTX that obscured warning signs of the underlying fraud.[^18]

Some commentators noted that concerns about Bankman-Fried's behavior had been raised within EA-adjacent circles as early as 2018, including concerns about negligence and misreporting at Alameda Research, and questioned why these concerns had not led to greater scrutiny of FTX's philanthropic activities.[^19]

### Impact on Effective Altruism

The collapse substantially damaged the effective altruism movement's reputation and funding landscape. The Future Fund had grown to represent a significant portion of EA-adjacent philanthropy in a short period, and many organizations had structured plans around anticipated FTX funding. Because EA organizations are often less diversified than commercial creditors, the loss of FTX funding was disproportionately disruptive.[^20]

The episode prompted reflection within the EA community about the risks of the "earn to give" model—wherein individuals pursue high-earning careers in order to donate proceeds to effective causes—and whether the model creates structural pressures that may compromise ethical behavior. The EA Forum resignation post from the Future Fund team generated extensive community discussion, with commentators debating the extent to which the fund's staff bore responsibility for failing to identify warning signs, and how EA funding structures should be reformed to reduce single-source concentration risk.[^21]

### Governance and Oversight Failures

Post-collapse analysis identified governance failures at FTX that should have raised red flags for due diligence. FTX reportedly lacked a chief financial officer for significant periods, had an inexperienced chief operating officer, and had no proper board of directors.[^17] Critics argued these were detectable warning signs that funders and affiliated organizations, including the Future Fund, did not adequately investigate before accepting or building around FTX's philanthropic commitments.[^17]

### Longtermism and Global Health Tensions

Some global health researchers and practitioners expressed concern about the fund's longtermist orientation more broadly, arguing that large sums devoted to speculative long-run risks came at the expense of more tractable near-term global health needs. While acknowledging some overlap in areas like pandemic preparedness, critics expressed wariness about a funding landscape in which longtermist priorities were displacing global health and development work within the EA ecosystem.[^7] Others questioned specific grant decisions, including some pandemic preparedness funding that critics characterized as potentially counterproductive.

## Impact on AI Safety Funding Infrastructure

The collapse of the FTX Future Fund exposed a significant vulnerability in AI safety research funding. The fund had rapidly grown into one of the largest single sources of AI safety philanthropic capital, and its sudden disappearance—with many grants returned or clawed back—created a meaningful funding gap in the field.[^10] Observers noted that the concentration of resources from a single source with no institutional independence from a for-profit exchange represented a structural fragility, and discussions followed about the need for more diversified and resilient funding mechanisms for AI safety research.[^22]

Many donations made after August 11, 2022, were required to be returned as part of the bankruptcy process.[^10]

## Key Uncertainties

- The full extent of grant clawbacks from the bankruptcy estate remains unclear. Creditors had the legal basis to attempt recovery of funds distributed in the months before the bankruptcy filing, but the actual outcomes of those proceedings are not fully documented in available sources.
- The degree to which Future Fund leadership was aware of irregularities at FTX prior to the collapse is disputed. An independent investigation by law firm Mintz, conducted on behalf of Effective Ventures, reportedly found no evidence that Future Fund personnel knew of issues at FTX, though a prediction market question about whether stronger evidence of prior suspicions would emerge remains unresolved.[^23]
- The long-term impact on AI safety and longtermist research funding is difficult to assess, as the field subsequently sought alternative funding sources.
