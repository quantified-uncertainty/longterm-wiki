llmSummary: "Valuation analysis updated for Series G (Feb 2026). Anthropic raised $30B at $380B post-money with $14B run-rate revenue, yielding ~27x multiple—now closer to OpenAI's 25x at $500B/$20B. Bull case rests on 88% enterprise retention (vs 76% industry), coding benchmark leadership (80.9% SWE-bench vs GPT-5.2's 74.9%), 500+ million-dollar customers, and dual AWS/Google Cloud partnerships worth tens of billions. Bear case includes severe customer concentration (≈$1.2B or 25%+ from Cursor and GitHub Copilot alone), margin compression (forecast cut from 50% to 40%), and bubble warnings—Sam Altman admits 'AI bubble is ongoing.' Extended scenarios model 1.5-5x growth ($500B-$1.75T) with revised probabilities."

## Overview

<EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink>'s <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380 billion</F> valuation (February 2026 Series G) reflects rapid revenue growth from <F e="anthropic" f="55d88868">\$9B</F> at end of 2025 to <F e="anthropic" f="0ed4db9e">\$14B</F> run-rate by the time of the funding round. At <Calc expr="{anthropic.6796e194} / {anthropic.0ed4db9e}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> current revenue, Anthropic now trades at a multiple closer to <EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink>'s <Calc expr="{openai.39d6868e} / {openai.609b9796}" precision={0} prefix="≈" suffix="x" /> (at <F e="openai" f="39d6868e">\$500B</F> with <F e="openai" f="609b9796">\$20B</F> ARR)—a convergence from the <Calc expr="{anthropic.c45b168f} / {anthropic.55d88868}" precision={0} prefix="≈" suffix="x" /> multiple at the previous <F e="anthropic" f="c45b168f">\$350B</F> valuation with <F e="anthropic" f="55d88868">\$9B</F> revenue.

This page provides an investment-grade analysis of scenarios across different outcomes, incorporating data on customer concentration, margin pressure, and competitive dynamics.[^1]

**Updated thesis**: The revenue multiple gap between Anthropic and OpenAI has narrowed substantially (<Calc expr="{anthropic.6796e194} / {anthropic.0ed4db9e}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> vs 25x). The remaining difference may reflect enterprise performance metrics (<F e="anthropic" f="640a5be5">88%</F> retention, 80% enterprise revenue, 500+ million-dollar customers) and coding benchmark positioning—or may indicate persistent valuation risk given customer concentration and margin compression.

## Current Valuation Context

### Revenue Multiple Comparison

| Company | Valuation | Revenue (Run Rate) | Multiple | Data Source |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Anthropic** | <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380B</F> (Series G, Feb 2026) | <F e="anthropic" f="0ed4db9e">\$14B</F> (Feb 2026) | <Calc expr="{anthropic.6796e194} / {anthropic.0ed4db9e}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> | [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation) |
| **Anthropic (prev.)** | <F e="anthropic" f="c45b168f">\$350B</F> (Nov 2025) | <F e="anthropic" f="55d88868">\$9B</F> (end 2025) | <Calc expr="{anthropic.c45b168f} / {anthropic.55d88868}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> | [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/anthropic-s-revenue-run-rate-tops-9-billion-as-vcs-pile-in) |
| **OpenAI** | <F e="openai" f="39d6868e">\$500B</F> | <F e="openai" f="609b9796">\$20B</F> (Jan 2026) | <Calc expr="{openai.39d6868e} / {openai.609b9796}" precision={0} prefix="≈" suffix="x" /> | [i10x](https://i10x.ai/news/openai-20-billion-arr-revenue-analysis) |
| **OpenAI (proposed)** | \$750-830B | <F e="openai" f="609b9796">\$20B</F> | 37-41x | [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/openai-is-reportedly-trying-to-raise-100b-at-an-830b-valuation/) |

**Key insight**: Anthropic's revenue growth from <F e="anthropic" f="55d88868">\$9B</F> to <F e="anthropic" f="0ed4db9e">\$14B</F> compressed its revenue multiple from <Calc expr="{anthropic.c45b168f} / {anthropic.55d88868}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> to <Calc expr="{anthropic.6796e194} / {anthropic.0ed4db9e}" precision={0} suffix="x" />, bringing it closer to <Calc expr="{openai.39d6868e} / {openai.609b9796}" precision={0} prefix="≈" suffix="x" />. The valuation itself only increased 8.6% (<F e="anthropic" f="c45b168f">\$350B</F> → <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380B</F>) while revenue grew 56%. If OpenAI closes its \$100B round at \$830B, OpenAI would trade at ≈41x—above Anthropic's current multiple.[^2]

### Revenue Growth Trajectories

| Company | 2024 | 2025 | Current Run Rate | 2026 (Guidance) | 2027 (Projected) |
|---------|------|------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Anthropic** | <F e="anthropic" f="bc497a3d">\$1B</F> | <F e="anthropic" f="55d88868">\$9B</F> | <F e="anthropic" f="0ed4db9e">\$14B</F> (Feb 2026) | <F e="anthropic" f="2038f3f6">\$20-26B</F> | \$34.5B |
| **OpenAI** | \$6B | <F e="openai" f="609b9796">\$20B</F> | <F e="openai" f="609b9796">\$20B</F> (Jan 2026) | \$46B (2.3x) | \$92B (2x) |

Both companies are growing rapidly. OpenAI projects reaching \$100B revenue by 2028.[^3]

### Valuation Progression

| Date | Round | Valuation | Revenue (ARR) | Multiple |
|------|-------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| May 2021 | Series A | \$550M | ≈\$0 | — |
| April 2022 | Series B | \$4B | ≈\$10M | 400x |
| March 2025 | Series E | \$61.5B | <F e="anthropic" f="bc497a3d">≈\$1B</F> | 62x |

| Feb 2026 | Series G | <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380B</F> | <F e="anthropic" f="0ed4db9e">≈\$14B</F> | <Calc expr="{anthropic.6796e194} / {anthropic.0ed4db9e}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> |

Multiple compression from 400x to <Calc expr="{anthropic.6796e194} / {anthropic.0ed4db9e}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> reflects a business with rapidly growing revenue scaling toward profitability.

## Bull Case: Data Supporting Higher Valuation

### 1. Enterprise Performance Metrics

Anthropic's enterprise metrics exceed industry benchmarks:

| Metric | Anthropic | Industry Average | Difference |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Enterprise retention** | <F e="anthropic" f="640a5be5">88%</F> | <F e="anthropic" f="7ccb9764">76%</F> | +12 percentage points |
| **Revenue from enterprise** | 80% | Varies | High-quality revenue |
| **Multi-year commitments** | Growing | Uncommon | Improved forecasting |
| **Large accounts (>\$100K)** | 7x YoY growth | — | Expansion pattern |

The <F e="anthropic" f="640a5be5">88%</F> retention rate indicates product-market fit and switching costs. Enterprise contracts include SLA guarantees, compliance certifications (HIPAA, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001), and custom data retention policies that create lock-in.[^4][^5]

### 2. Coding Benchmark Performance

Claude leads commercially important software development benchmarks:

| Benchmark | Claude Opus 4.5 | GPT-5.2 | Gemini 3 Pro | Leader |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|--------------|--------|
| **SWE-bench Verified** | 80.9% | 74.9% | 76.8% | Claude |
| **Terminal-bench 2.0** | 59.3% | — | — | Claude |
| **Prompt injection resistance** | 4.7% success | 21.9% | 12.5% | Claude |
| **AIME 2025 (math)** | — | 100% | — | GPT-5.2 |
| **GPQA Diamond (science)** | — | — | 91.9% | Gemini |

Claude leads in SWE-bench (software engineering tasks) and security (lowest prompt injection rate). No single model dominates all categories—GPT-5.2 leads reasoning, Gemini leads multimodal.[^6][^7]

### 3. Dual Cloud Infrastructure Partnerships

Anthropic has secured infrastructure commitments from both major cloud providers:

**Amazon Web Services:**
- \$8B total investment from Amazon
- 1 million+ Trainium2 chips committed
- \$11B dedicated data center in Indiana
- Projected \$1.28B → \$3B → \$5.6B AWS revenue (2025 → 2026 → 2027)

**Google Cloud:**
- "Tens of billions" TPU deal announced October 2025
- Expands beyond AWS dependency
- Access to both Trainium and TPU architectures[^8][^9]

This dual-cloud strategy reduces infrastructure risk and provides leverage in chip negotiations.

### 4. Technical Leadership Team

Anthropic's founding team includes researchers from <EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink>:

**Founding Team (7 ex-OpenAI researchers):**
- <EntityLink id="E91">Dario Amodei</EntityLink> (CEO) - Former VP Research at OpenAI
- <EntityLink id="E90">Daniela Amodei</EntityLink> (President) - Former VP Operations at OpenAI
- <EntityLink id="E59">Chris Olah</EntityLink> - <EntityLink id="E174">Interpretability</EntityLink> researcher
- Tom Brown - Lead author of GPT-3
- Jared Kaplan - Scaling laws researcher

**Key Acquisitions:**
- <EntityLink id="E182">Jan Leike</EntityLink> (2024) - Former OpenAI Superalignment co-lead
- John Schulman (2024) - OpenAI co-founder, invented PPO algorithm
- <EntityLink id="E156">Holden Karnofsky</EntityLink> (2025) - <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> co-founder

**Team Scale:**
- Interpretability team: <F e="anthropic" f="28a43350">40-60</F> researchers (largest globally)
- Safety researchers: <F e="anthropic" f="e68b2ebf">200-330</F> (<F e="anthropic" f="d8034d80">20-30%</F> of technical staff)

### 5. Open Source Competition Dynamics

Open-source models' enterprise market share has declined:

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Open source enterprise share** | 19% | 11% | Declining |
| **Llama enterprise production** | Higher | 9% | Declining |
| **Anthropic/OpenAI/Google share** | — | 88% | Consolidating |

Llama 4's launch underperformed in real-world settings according to enterprise surveys. The performance gap between open and proprietary models widened throughout 2024-2025.[^10]

## Bear Case: Data Indicating Valuation Risk

### 1. Customer Concentration Risk

Anthropic's revenue shows concentration in two customers:

| Customer | Estimated Revenue | Share of Total |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Cursor** | ≈\$600M | ≈13% |
| **GitHub Copilot** | ≈\$600M | ≈13% |
| **Combined** | ≈\$1.2B | <F e="anthropic" f="fac5b934">≈25%+</F> |

Approximately <F e="anthropic" f="fac5b934">25%</F> of Anthropic's revenue comes from two coding tool customers. If either relationship ends or shifts to a competitor, revenue would decline. This concentration in AI-assisted coding also means Anthropic is vulnerable to disruption in that specific market.[^11]

### 2. Gross Margin Revision

Anthropic revised its gross margin forecast:

| Metric | Original Forecast | Revised Forecast | Change |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| **2025 Gross Margin** | 50% | <F e="anthropic" f="a1e87600">40%</F> | -10 percentage points |
| **Cause** | — | Rising inference costs | Structural |

AI inference costs scale with usage. Unlike traditional software with near-zero marginal costs, every AI query consumes compute. As revenue grows, costs grow—potentially faster than efficiency gains can offset.[^12][^13]

For comparison, OpenAI reports 70% "compute margin" but overall gross margins are 40-50% after partner revenue shares and free-tier subsidies.[^14]

### 3. AI Valuation Environment Assessments

Multiple sources have characterized current AI valuations as elevated:

| Source | Statement | Date |
|--------|---------|------|
| **<EntityLink id="E269">Sam Altman</EntityLink> (OpenAI CEO)** | "AI bubble is ongoing" | 2025 |
| **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan)** | "Higher chance of meaningful drop" than markets reflect | 2025 |
| **DeepSeek launch impact** | <EntityLink id="E693">Nvidia</EntityLink> dropped 17% in one day | Jan 2025 |
| **Market concentration** | 30% of S&P 500 in 5 companies—highest concentration in half a century | Late 2025 |

When the CEO of OpenAI characterizes the market as experiencing bubble conditions, valuations across the sector face uncertainty.[^15][^16]

### 4. Benchmark Distribution Across Categories

While Claude leads coding, it does not lead all categories:

| Category | Leader | Claude's Position |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Coding | Claude | #1 |
| Mathematical reasoning | GPT-5.2 | Behind |
| Scientific knowledge | Gemini 3 Pro | Behind |
| Multimodal/context | Gemini (1M tokens) | Smaller context |

The market appears to be evolving toward model routing—using different models for different tasks—rather than winner-take-all. This limits any single company's ability to capture the entire market.[^17]

### 5. OpenAI's Scale Position

OpenAI has scale advantages in certain metrics:

| Metric | OpenAI | Anthropic | Gap |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----|
| **Weekly active users** | 800M | Unknown | Large differential |
| **Revenue** | <F e="openai" f="609b9796">\$20B</F> | <F e="anthropic" f="0ed4db9e">\$14B</F> | 1.4x |
| **Total raised** | — | <F e="anthropic" f="226cc0eb">\$67B+</F> | — |
| **Valuation (proposed)** | \$750-830B | <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380B</F> | 2.0-2.2x |

If OpenAI raises \$100B at \$830B, it will have capital to invest in compute, talent, and product development.[^18]

## Revised Valuation Scenarios

Given updated data, probability-weighted scenarios:

| Scenario | Valuation | Multiple vs Current | Probability | Key Drivers |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Bear** | \$175-250B | 0.5-0.7x | 15-20% | Market correction, customer churn |
| **Base** | <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380B</F> | 1x | 40-50% | Status quo, margin pressure offsets growth |
| **Moderate Bull** | \$500-700B | 1.3-1.8x | 20-30% | Diversified customers, sustained growth |
| **Strong Bull** | \$1-1.75T | 2.6-4.6x | 5-10% | Market leadership, AGI progress |

**Key change from previous analysis**: With the Series G at <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380B</F> and <F e="anthropic" f="0ed4db9e">\$14B</F> revenue (<Calc expr="{anthropic.6796e194} / {anthropic.0ed4db9e}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> multiple), Anthropic's valuation multiple relative to OpenAI has converged. The revenue growth trajectory is now the primary valuation driver rather than a premium multiple.

## Unit Economics Analysis

### Gross Margin Comparison

| Company | Compute Margin | Overall Gross Margin | Trend |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Anthropic** | Unknown | <F e="anthropic" f="a1e87600">40%</F> (revised) | Declining |
| **OpenAI** | 70% | 40-50% | Improving |
| **Mature SaaS** | N/A | 70-80% | Stable |

AI companies operate with structurally lower margins than traditional SaaS due to inference costs. This may improve with efficiency gains, but the timeline is uncertain.

### Path to Profitability

| Milestone | Anthropic | OpenAI |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Stop burning cash** | 2027 | Unknown |
| **Breakeven** | <F e="anthropic" f="023e1116">2028</F> | "Years away" |
| **Positive FCF** | 2027 (projected \$17B by 2028) | Unknown |

Anthropic projects reaching <F e="anthropic" f="023e1116">breakeven in 2028</F>, which provides visibility into profitability timeline.[^19]

## Implications for Stakeholders

### For Investors

| Scenario | Return | Risk Assessment |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Bear (-50%)** | -50% | Customer concentration, market correction |
| **Base (0%)** | 0% | Current pricing reflects fair value at <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380B</F> |
| **Moderate Bull (+30-85%)** | +30-85% | Growth execution, multiple expansion |
| **Strong Bull (+160%+)** | +160%+ | Market dominance, requires sustained execution |

The risk/reward profile has shifted since Anthropic's revenue multiple compressed from <Calc expr="{anthropic.c45b168f} / {anthropic.55d88868}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> to <Calc expr="{anthropic.6796e194} / {anthropic.0ed4db9e}" precision={0} suffix="x" />. The downside risk from multiple compression is reduced, though sector-wide corrections remain a risk.

### For EA-Aligned Capital

See <EntityLink id="E406">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink> for detailed philanthropic capital analysis:

| Valuation | Risk-Adjusted EA Capital |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| \$175B (bear) | \$12-35B |
| <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194">\$380B</F> (current) | \$27-76B |
| \$700B (moderate bull) | \$50-140B |
| \$1T+ (strong bull) | \$70-200B+ |

### For the AI Safety Field

Anthropic's trajectory affects the field regardless of exact valuation:

1. **Talent attraction**: Valuations at current levels attract safety researchers
2. **Model legitimacy**: Demonstrates "safety lab" can compete commercially
3. **Research funding**: Higher valuations fund more <EntityLink id="E265">safety research</EntityLink>
4. **Industry influence**: Commercial success encourages competitors to adopt safety practices
