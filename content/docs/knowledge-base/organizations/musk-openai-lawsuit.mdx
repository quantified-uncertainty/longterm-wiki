llmSummary: "Elon Musk is suing OpenAI, Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Microsoft for $79-134B, alleging they fraudulently induced his $38M donation by promising to maintain nonprofit status, then converted to for-profit. Trial scheduled April 27, 2026. Four claims survived dismissal: breach of charitable trust, constructive fraud, fraud, and unjust enrichment. Key evidence includes Greg Brockman's internal note calling the conversion 'morally bankrupt.' The Foundation's $130B equity stake is at risk if courts find the nonprofit entity committed breach of charitable trust. Outcome probability: 40-50% settlement, 15-25% partial Musk win, 5-10% full Musk win, 25-35% OpenAI wins."

## Overview

<EntityLink id="E116">Elon Musk</EntityLink> filed suit against <EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="E269">Sam Altman</EntityLink>, Greg Brockman, and Microsoft in August 2024, alleging that OpenAI's leadership fraudulently induced his \$38 million seed donation by promising the organization would remain a nonprofit dedicated to beneficial AI—then converted to a for-profit structure that enriched insiders.

The case survived partial dismissal in January 2026, with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruling there is "plenty of evidence" that OpenAI's leaders made assurances about maintaining the nonprofit structure. A jury trial is scheduled for April 27, 2026.

## Defendants

| Defendant | Role | Alleged Conduct |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **OpenAI** (entity) | Primary defendant | Breached nonprofit mission and charitable trust |
| **Sam Altman** | CEO, co-founder | Fraud, misrepresentation about nonprofit commitment |
| **Greg Brockman** | President, co-founder | Fraud, misrepresentation (despite internal doubts) |
| **Microsoft** | 27% stakeholder | Aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty |

## Claims and Status

### Surviving Claims (Going to Jury)

| Claim | Legal Basis | Strength |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Breach of charitable trust** | Nonprofit assets diverted from charitable purpose | Moderate—jury question |
| **Constructive fraud** | Fiduciary relationship created duty to disclose | Strong—internal docs help Musk |
| **Fraud** | Intentional misrepresentation to induce donation | Contested |
| **Unjust enrichment** | Insiders profited from Musk's charitable donation | Strongest claim |

### Dismissed Claim

| Claim | Reason for Dismissal |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Breach of contract** | No written contract existed specifying nonprofit status in perpetuity |

The judge noted this was a "toss-up" case with evidence pointing in both directions.

## Damages Sought: \$79-134 Billion

Musk's expert witness, financial economist C. Paul Wazzan, calculated damages as Musk's proportional share of OpenAI's current \$500B+ valuation based on his seed funding:

| Calculation Approach | Amount | Basis |
|---------------------|--------|-------|
| **Low estimate** | \$79 billion | Conservative valuation multiple |
| **High estimate** | \$134 billion | Full proportional share of current valuation |
| **Musk's investment** | \$38 million | Original seed donation |
| **Implied return** | 2,000-3,500x | If Musk wins full damages |

The theory: Musk is entitled to returns "as an early startup investor" because his donation was induced by fraud about the nonprofit structure.

## Key Evidence

### Musk's Strongest Evidence

**Greg Brockman internal note:**
> "It'd be wrong to steal the nonprofit from [Musk]. To convert to a b-corp without him. That'd be pretty morally bankrupt."

This suggests OpenAI leadership knew the transition raised ethical issues regarding Musk's position as a donor who expected nonprofit status to continue.

**Additional supporting evidence:**
- Public statements about permanent nonprofit commitment
- Musk's role as co-founder and board member
- Timing of for-profit discussions (began while Musk was still involved)
- Scale of insider enrichment post-conversion

### OpenAI's Defense

| Defense | Argument |
|---------|----------|
| **Musk agreed to transition** | Emails show Musk discussed for-profit structure |
| **No written restriction** | Musk's donation had no contractual conditions |
| **Musk wanted control** | He only objected when denied leadership role |
| **Competitor harassment** | Lawsuit is competitive attack via xAI |
| **Brockman note out of context** | Quote misrepresents actual events |

OpenAI has published emails purporting to show Musk was aware of and participated in for-profit discussions before his departure.

## Trial Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **August 2024** | Musk files lawsuit |
| **February 2025** | Musk-led consortium offers \$97.4B to acquire nonprofit |
| **January 2026** | Judge denies OpenAI's motion to dismiss key claims |
| **January 2026** | Judge rules "plenty of evidence" for jury trial |
| **April 27, 2026** | Trial begins in Oakland, California |

## Foundation Assets at Risk

### Why the \$130B Stake Is Vulnerable

Musk's \$38 million donation went to the **original nonprofit entity** (now the OpenAI Foundation). If courts find that nonprofit committed breach of charitable trust, damages could come from Foundation assets.

### Potential Outcomes and Impact

| Outcome | Probability | Impact on Foundation |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Musk wins full \$134B** | 5-10% | Catastrophic—Foundation loses entire stake |
| **Musk wins partial (\$10-50B)** | 15-25% | Severe—major stake reduction |
| **Settlement** | 40-50% | Moderate—likely \$5-20B range |
| **OpenAI wins** | 25-35% | None—status quo preserved |

### Who Actually Pays?

| Source | Amount Available | Likelihood |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **OpenAI Group PBC** | ≈\$500B valuation | Most likely primary target |
| **Microsoft** | Deep pockets | Joint liability if aiding/abetting found |
| **OpenAI Foundation** | ≈\$130B equity | At risk for charitable trust claims |
| **Altman/Brockman personally** | Unknown | Possible for individual fraud claims |

The Foundation's equity stake is genuinely at risk because Musk's donations went to the nonprofit, so that's where the breach of charitable trust occurred.

## Prediction Market Odds

As of February 2026, prediction markets show meaningful probability of a Musk victory:

| Platform | Musk Wins | Musk Loses | Volume |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/event/will-elon-musk-win-his-case-against-sam-altman)** | 53% | 47% | \$54,751 |
| **[Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/markets/kxmuskoai/elon-win-vs-open-ai/kxmuskoai-26)** | 55-68% | 32-45% | \$223,599 |

Kalshi odds [jumped to 68-72%](https://cryptobriefing.com/elon-musk-lawsuit-against-openai/) after new court filings revealed OpenAI leadership contemplated the for-profit pivot earlier than publicly acknowledged.

### Market Resolution Criteria

The markets define "win" narrowly:
- Musk must receive a **larger net monetary award** than defendants
- Settlements with disclosed payments to Musk count as "Yes"
- Only trial-level outcomes count (not appeals)
- Must resolve by end of 2026

## Estimated Damages Distribution

The range of potential outcomes spans from \$0 to \$134B:

| Outcome | Amount | Probability | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Musk loses outright** | \$0 | 30-35% | OpenAI's emails show Musk knew about for-profit plans |
| **Nuisance settlement** | \$100M-\$1B | 10-15% | OpenAI pays to avoid trial distraction |
| **Moderate settlement** | \$1B-\$10B | 20-25% | Most likely single outcome |
| **Large settlement/verdict** | \$10B-\$30B | 10-15% | Jury finds fraud but applies discount |
| **Major verdict** | \$30B-\$75B | 5-8% | Substantial "unjust enrichment" award |
| **Full/near-full judgment** | \$75B-\$134B | 2-5% | Jury accepts Musk's full damages theory |

### Expected Value Calculation

| Outcome | Midpoint | Probability | Contribution |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Loses | \$0 | 32% | \$0 |
| Nuisance | \$500M | 12% | \$60M |
| Moderate | \$5B | 22% | \$1.1B |
| Large | \$20B | 12% | \$2.4B |
| Major | \$50B | 7% | \$3.5B |
| Full | \$100B | 3% | \$3B |
| **Expected Value** | — | — | **≈\$10B** |

### Impact on Foundation by Award Size

| Musk Award | Foundation Stake After | % Remaining |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| \$0 | \$130B | 100% |
| \$5B | \$125B | 96% |
| \$20B | \$110B | 85% |
| \$50B | \$80B | 62% |
| \$100B | \$30B | 23% |
| \$134B | \$0 | 0% |

## The Accountability Paradox

A Musk victory creates a troubling outcome: money intended for "beneficial AI" transfers to the world's richest person.

### Where The Money Goes

| Scenario | Destination | Who Benefits |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Status quo** | Sits in Foundation (0.04%/year donated) | OpenAI insiders (stock appreciation) |
| **Musk wins big** | Transfers to Musk's \$700B fortune | World's richest person |
| **Foundation does philanthropy** | AI safety, health research | Humanity |

### Why This Is Problematic

Musk's net worth exceeds \$700 billion. A \$10-50B lawsuit recovery:
- Has near-zero marginal utility to Musk personally
- Depletes assets nominally designated for charitable purposes
- Doesn't fund AI safety work (Musk would likely invest in xAI)
- Sets useful legal precedent but at enormous cost

### What Should Happen (But Won't)

| Better Outcome | Why It Won't Happen |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Musk pledges winnings to AI safety orgs | Not his style; he'd fund xAI instead |
| Court directs funds to independent charity | Not how civil lawsuits work |
| Settlement includes governance reforms, not cash | Musk wants the money |
| CA AG pursues case instead | AG lacks resources/standing |

### Net Effect on AI Safety Funding

| Outcome | Money for AI Safety Work |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Musk loses | Whatever Foundation donates (probably little) |
| Musk wins \$50B | \$50B less in Foundation + \$0 from Musk = net negative |
| Settlement with governance terms | Potentially positive if reforms are real |

**The uncomfortable question:** Is setting legal precedent worth transferring tens of billions from a (poorly governed) charity to someone who will spend it on Mars rockets?

## Legal Significance

### Precedent for Nonprofit Conversions

If Musk prevails, the ruling could establish:

1. **Original donor intent constrains restructuring** — Donors can challenge conversions that betray their expectations
2. **Nonprofits cannot simply convert** — Charitable assets must be protected, not enriched insiders
3. **Fiduciary duty to mission** — Board members can be held liable for mission abandonment
4. **No "founding agreement" loophole** — Lack of written contract doesn't eliminate fiduciary obligations

### Implications for AI Governance

The case tests whether "safety-focused nonprofit" commitments made during AI company formation can be legally enforced. If Musk loses, it signals that AI companies can freely restructure regardless of founding commitments. If Musk wins, future AI organizations may face stricter constraints on governance changes.

## Ironic Implications

If Musk wins a large judgment:

1. **Foundation assets depleted** — The \$130B stake that was supposed to fund "beneficial AI" work could instead go to the world's richest person

2. **Charitable purpose frustrated** — Money that might have funded AI safety research goes to Musk

3. **Same-board problem becomes moot** — If there's nothing left in the Foundation, governance theater doesn't matter

4. **Musk as accidental regulator** — His lawsuit may be the only external force that actually constrains OpenAI

The case demonstrates how legal challenges, rather than internal governance, may be the primary accountability mechanism for AI company restructurings.

## Key Uncertainties

| Question | Significance |
|----------|--------------|
| **Will the Brockman note sway the jury?** | Most damaging piece of evidence for OpenAI |
| **Can OpenAI's emails establish Musk's knowledge?** | Critical to fraud defense |
| **How will jury value "unjust enrichment"?** | Determines damage calculation |
| **Will Microsoft face joint liability?** | Expands potential recovery sources |
| **Settlement before trial?** | Most likely outcome—terms would be key |
