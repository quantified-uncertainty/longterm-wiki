## Overview

OpenAI is the AI research company that catalyzed mainstream artificial intelligence adoption through ChatGPT and the GPT model series. Founded in 2015 as a non-profit with the mission to ensure AGI benefits humanity, OpenAI has undergone dramatic organizational evolution: from open research lab to secretive commercial entity, from safety-focused non-profit to product-driven corporation racing toward AGI.

The company achieved breakthrough capabilities through massive scale (GPT-3's 175B parameters), pioneered <EntityLink id="E259">Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</EntityLink> as a practical alignment technique, and launched ChatGPT—reaching 800 million weekly active users by early 2025[^1] and maintaining 81.13% market share in generative AI[^2]. However, OpenAI's trajectory reveals mounting tensions between commercial pressures and safety priorities, exemplified by the November 2023 board crisis that temporarily ousted CEO <EntityLink id="E269">Sam Altman</EntityLink> and the 2024 exodus of key safety researchers including co-founder <EntityLink id="E163">Ilya Sutskever</EntityLink>.

With over \$13 billion in <EntityLink id="E550">Microsoft</EntityLink> investment and aggressive capability advancement through reasoning models like o1 and the recent o3-mini release[^3], OpenAI sits at the center of debates about AI safety governance, racing dynamics, and whether commercial incentives can align with existential risk mitigation.
