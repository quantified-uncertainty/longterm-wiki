## Overview

Manifund is a charitable funding platform that emerged from Manifold Markets in 2022 to address a critical gap in the effective altruism funding ecosystem: the need for fast, flexible grantmaking that can move money to promising projects within days rather than months. Founded by Austin Chen and Rachel Weinberg, Manifund operates as both a regranting platform and a fiscal sponsor, enabling donors to support projects that lack formal nonprofit status while receiving tax benefits.

The platform's origin traces to a concrete pain point: Manifold Markets received a \$500,000 grant from the FTX Future Fund in 2022 for charity prediction markets, but needed a separate 501(c)(3) entity to process the funds. What began as "Manifold for Charity" evolved into a full funding platform after Scott Alexander approached the team in 2022 wanting to run ACX Grants through an impact certificate mechanism. Austin Chen recruited his then-girlfriend (now wife) Rachel Weinberg to build the platform, and she became the primary engineer for manifund.org, launching it within two weeks.

Manifund distinguishes itself from traditional foundations through three mechanisms. First, it empowers individual regrantors with independent budgets of \$50,000-\$400,000 to make grant decisions without committee review, enabling faster and more speculative funding. Second, it experimented extensively with impact certificates, a mechanism where funders can retroactively purchase credit for completed work. Third, it provides infrastructure for programs like ACX Grants, where external funders can run their own grantmaking through the platform.

The platform serves a critical "middle layer" function in the EA funding ecosystem. Large funders like <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> operate at scale but require months of due diligence. EA Funds and Long-Term Future Fund operate at medium scale with multi-week timelines. Manifund fills the niche for \$5,000-\$50,000 grants that can be disbursed within a week, often seeding projects that later receive larger grants from major funders. As one regrantor noted, "quick regrants induce further funding from OpenPhil and others."

## Founding Team

### Austin Chen

Austin Chen co-founded <EntityLink id="E546">Manifold</EntityLink> Markets in December 2021 alongside brothers Stephen and James Grugett. He served as Chief Product Officer before stepping back from day-to-day Manifold operations to focus on Manifund. Chen's entrepreneurial approach emphasizes rapid experimentation and community-driven development.

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Role** | CEO and Co-founder, Manifund |
| **Previous** | CPO and Co-founder, Manifold Markets |
| **Education** | MIT (Computer Science) |
| **Notable** | Pioneered play-money <EntityLink id="E228">prediction markets</EntityLink> at scale |

Chen's philosophy centers on building infrastructure that empowers individual decision-makers rather than committees. When discussing Manifund's regranting model, he emphasized that "regrantors make grants solo and are directly responsible for grant quality, which encourages more speculative grants and avoids problems in review-by-committee."

### Rachel Weinberg

Rachel Weinberg serves as the primary engineer and co-founder of Manifund. She joined after Austin Chen approached her about building the impact certificate platform for Scott Alexander's ACX Grants program.

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Role** | Co-founder and Lead Engineer, Manifund |
| **Previous** | President, EA @ Tufts University |
| **Education** | Tufts University (Mathematics, partial degree) |
| **Community** | Organized small-to-medium EA events |

Weinberg's background in effective altruism community building informed Manifund's design philosophy. She founded and ran the EA group at Tufts before transitioning to engineering. Her rapid development of manifund.org, launching within two weeks of starting, enabled the platform to process its first grants quickly.

### Regranting Programs

Regranting is Manifund's primary funding mechanism, pioneered by the FTX Future Fund in 2022. The model empowers individual experts ("regrantors") with independent budgets to make grant decisions without committee approval. Manifund launched its regranting program in May 2023 after being introduced to an anonymous donor "D" who provided \$1.5 million specifically for this purpose.

| Program Year | Total Pool | Number of Regrantors | Budget per Regrantor | Focus |
|--------------|------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 2023 | \$1.4M | 5 | \$50K-400K | AI safety, EA causes |
| 2024 | ≈\$2M | ≈12 | \$50K-400K | AI safety primary |
| 2025 | \$2.25M | 10 (announced) | \$100K+ | AI safety primary |

**Notable 2024 Regrantors:**
- Neel Nanda (Mechanistic interpretability researcher, Anthropic)
- Leopold Aschenbrenner (Former OpenAI researcher, Situational Awareness author)
- Dan Hendrycks (Center for AI Safety director)
- Adam Gleave (FAR AI founder)
- Ryan Kidd (SERI MATS co-director)
- Evan Hubinger (Anthropic alignment researcher)

**2025 Regrantors** include several former Manifund grantees who have become grantmakers:
- Tamay Besiroglu (Epoch AI)
- Lisa Thiergart (MIRI)
- Marius Hobbhahn (Apollo Research)

The regranting model offers several structural advantages over traditional grantmaking. Speed is paramount: Manifund can move money from recommendation to grantee bank account in under one week. The model also encourages "hits-based giving" where regrantors can make speculative bets on early-stage projects that committee processes might reject. Each regrantor writes public explanations for their grants, creating accountability and enabling learning across the ecosystem.

### ACX Grants

Scott Alexander's Astral Codex Ten grant program represents one of Manifund's largest partnerships. Alexander committed \$250,000 of personal funds in 2024, with other donors contributing an additional ≈\$1 million through Manifund's infrastructure.

| Year | Scott's Commitment | Total Distributed | Applications | Grants Made |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024 | \$250,000 | ≈\$1.25M | 600+ | ≈40 |
| 2025 | \$250,000 | TBD | 654 | 42 |

**Notable ACX Grants (2024):**

| Recipient | Amount | Project |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Elaine Perlman | \$50,000 | Lobbying for kidney donation law reform |
| John Lohier & Hugo Smith | \$13,000 | Lead-acid battery recycling research in Nigeria |
| Mark Webb | \$5,000 | Direct land reform experimentation |
| Various | \$5K-50K | Biotech, AI alignment, education, climate projects |

The 2024 ACX Grants introduced an impact market component where applications not receiving direct grants could participate in a secondary market. Retroactive prize funders including ACX Grants 2025, Survival and Flourishing Fund, Long-Term Future Fund, Animal Welfare Fund, and EA Infrastructure Fund (collectively disbursing \$5-33M annually) committed to purchasing successful impact certificates.

### Impact Certificates

Impact certificates represent Manifund's most experimental funding mechanism. The concept functions like "Kickstarter meets the stock market, for charity": founders create proposals with minimum funding goals, accredited investors bid in auctions, and successful projects issue tradeable certificates representing credit for completed work. Retroactive funders can later purchase certificates for projects that demonstrated impact.

| Aspect | Implementation | Results |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Mechanism** | Auction-based initial funding; tradeable certificates | Facilitated 20+ project fundings |
| **Investor Interest** | Lower than expected | Struggled to attract speculative investors |
| **Trading Volume** | Limited | AMMs implemented but underutilized |
| **Learning Value** | High | Informed future mechanism design |

**Key Learnings from Impact Certificate Experiments:**

Manifund ran three major impact certificate programs through Q1 2024: ACX Grants, Manifold Community Fund, and ChinaTalk essay competition. The team concluded they were "less excited by impact certificates than before" due to several challenges:

1. **Investor acquisition difficulty**: The use case of speculating on charitable projects did not attract sufficient investor interest beyond the EA community.

2. **Evaluation burden**: Assessing project impact proved time-consuming and "wasn't that fun," with participation declining each evaluation round.

3. **Trading mechanism complexity**: Implementing automated market makers facilitated more trading but didn't justify the engineering cost. All AMMs were overpriced because the system supported buying and selling but not shorting.

4. **Brand/prize insufficiency**: When partnering with Coefficient Giving's essay contest, most essayists declined to create impact certificates, including all ultimate winners. This demonstrated that "large dollar prizes plus well-known brands are not sufficient to get a robust certificate ecosystem started."

Despite these challenges, Manifund views the experiments positively for the learning they generated. The platform continues to support impact certificates while focusing more resources on regranting, which has demonstrated clearer product-market fit.

### Donor Lottery

Manifund hosts donor lotteries following the model established by Carl Shulman and Paul Christiano in 2017. The mechanism allows donors to pool contributions, with one randomly-selected winner receiving the entire pool to distribute as grants.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Entry Range** | \$1,000 - \$100,000 |
| **Typical Pool Size** | \$100,000 - \$500,000 |
| **Winner Selection** | Random, proportional to contribution |
| **Allocation Period** | ≈6 months to distribute |

The donor lottery rationale exploits increasing marginal returns to donation research. A \$1,000 donor gains a 1% chance of allocating \$100,000, making extensive research worthwhile. Winners often spend dozens of hours investigating giving opportunities, producing higher-quality grant decisions than thousands of small donors making quick choices.

## Fiscal Sponsorship Model

Manifund operates as a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor, providing critical infrastructure for projects that lack formal nonprofit status. This enables tax-deductible donations to individuals, unregistered projects, and even for-profit companies (pending due diligence).

`} />

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Tax Status** | 501(c)(3) nonprofit |
| **Fee Structure** | 5% for large donors (covers operations) |
| **Eligible Grantees** | Registered charities, individuals, for-profits (with review) |
| **Restrictions** | No political campaigns or lobbying |
| **Processing Time** | Days to one week |

The fiscal sponsorship model solves a key friction point in EA funding: many promising projects are led by individuals or small teams without formal nonprofit status. Traditional foundations cannot easily fund such projects. Manifund bridges this gap by accepting donations, conducting basic due diligence, and disbursing funds while maintaining tax compliance.

### When to Apply to Manifund vs. Other Funders

**Apply to Manifund when:**
- You need funding quickly (weeks, not months)
- Grant size is \$5K-75K
- Project is early-stage or speculative
- You lack nonprofit status
- You want to test an idea before seeking larger funding

**Apply to LTFF/Coefficient Giving when:**
- Project requires \$100K+
- You have time for longer review process
- Project has clear track record to evaluate
- You need multi-year funding commitment

## Strengths and Limitations

### Organizational Strengths

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **Speed** | Grant recommendation to disbursement in under 1 week |
| **Flexibility** | Multiple funding mechanisms (regrants, impact certs, lotteries) |
| **Transparency** | All grants public with rationales |
| **Low Overhead** | Small team, 5% fee covers operations |
| **Innovation** | Pioneered impact certificates at scale in EA |
| **Accessibility** | Easy application, fiscal sponsorship available |
| **Expert Networks** | Top AI safety researchers as regrantors |

### Limitations

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| **Scale** | \$2M annually vs. \$100M+ at OpenPhil | Focus on early-stage, speculative grants |
| **Due Diligence** | Less thorough than major foundations | Leverage regrantor expertise; accept higher variance |
| **Regrantor Availability** | Grant quality depends on regrantor capacity | Maintain 10+ active regrantors |
| **Sustainability** | Relies on continued donor participation | Diversify funding sources; build track record |
| **Focus** | Primarily AI safety/EA community | Intentional; serves specific ecosystem need |

### Impact Certificate Challenges

The impact certificate mechanism faced specific challenges that limited its effectiveness:

| Challenge | Observed Result |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Investor Acquisition** | Failed to attract investors outside EA community |
| **Evaluation Burden** | Team participation declined over time |
| **Trading Liquidity** | AMMs implemented but underutilized |
| **Mainstream Adoption** | Coefficient Giving essay contest participants declined certificates |

Manifund continues supporting impact certificates while recognizing that regranting has demonstrated stronger product-market fit.

## Strategic Position in EA Funding Ecosystem

Manifund fills a specific niche in the effective altruism funding landscape: fast, flexible, small-to-medium grants that seed early-stage projects. This complements rather than competes with larger funders.

| Ecosystem Role | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Seed Funder** | Provides initial funding that enables projects to later secure larger grants |
| **Speed Layer** | Moves money in days when other funders take months |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Regrantors can make speculative bets committees might reject |
| **Talent Identification** | Regrantors with field expertise spot promising individuals early |
| **Infrastructure Provider** | Fiscal sponsorship enables funding to non-charities |

Several Manifund-funded projects have subsequently received larger grants from <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> and other major funders, validating the "quick regrants induce further funding" thesis.
