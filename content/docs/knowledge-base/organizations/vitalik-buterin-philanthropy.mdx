| **Largest Donation** | **\$665.8M to FLI** (2021, cryptocurrency) |

## Overview

Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, has emerged as one of the most significant individual donors to AI safety and longtermist causes. His **\$665.8 million donation to the Future of Life Institute** in 2021 represents one of the largest single donations to AI safety-related work in history. Unlike many tech billionaires whose philanthropy focuses on traditional causes like global health or education, Buterin has explicitly prioritized existential risk reduction, particularly AI safety, alongside longevity research and crypto ecosystem development.

His giving is characterized by technical sophistication, willingness to fund speculative research, and close alignment with the effective altruism community. Buterin has been transparent about his reasoning, frequently discussing cause prioritization and funding decisions on his blog and social media.

In addition to the FLI donation, the 2021 "meme coin" incident—in which Buterin donated or burned over \$1 billion worth of tokens that had been sent to his wallet unsolicited—demonstrated both his willingness to make dramatic philanthropic gestures and the complexity of valuing crypto-based donations.

In various interviews and blog posts, Buterin has expressed concern about AI risks while maintaining nuanced views that don't fit neatly into "doomer" or "accelerationist" camps.

## Major Donations and Grants

### AI Safety and Existential Risk

| Recipient | Amount | Year | Focus |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| **Future of Life Institute (FLI)** | **\$665.8M** | 2021 | AI safety, x-risk research grants |
| **<EntityLink id="miri">MIRI</EntityLink>** | \$5M+ | 2017-present | Technical alignment research |
| **<EntityLink id="miri">MIRI</EntityLink>** | \$2.4M | 2017 | Largest individual donation at the time |
| **Biosecurity initiatives** | \$5M+ | 2020-present | Pandemic preparedness |
| **AI safety research** | \$3M+ | 2022-present | Various researchers and orgs |
| **Balvi** | Founder | 2021 | COVID response, then expanded |

### The FLI Donation (2021)

In 2021, Buterin donated **\$665.8 million** in cryptocurrency to the Future of Life Institute—the largest single donation in FLI's history and one of the largest donations to AI safety-adjacent causes ever. The donation:

- Provided FLI with substantial endowment for long-term operations
- Funded the \$25M 2021 grant program for AI safety and governance research
- Made Buterin FLI's "largest donor by far" (acknowledged on website May 2023)
- Helped cover FLI's operational deficits (2023 income was only \$624K)

This donation alone represents more than **4x the total annual funding** for all AI safety research from other sources combined.

### Longevity and Life Extension

| Recipient | Amount | Year | Focus |
|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| **SENS Research Foundation** | \$2.4M | 2018 | Anti-aging research |
| **Methuselah Foundation** | \$1M+ | Various | Longevity prizes |
| **Various longevity startups** | \$5M+ | 2020-present | Direct investments/grants |

### Crypto Public Goods and Ecosystem

| Initiative | Amount | Year | Focus |
|------------|--------|------|-------|
| **Gitcoin Grants** | \$10M+ | 2019-present | Quadratic funding for public goods |
| **Protocol Guild** | \$1M+ | 2022-present | Ethereum core developer funding |
| **Various DAOs** | \$5M+ | 2020-present | Decentralized governance experiments |

### The 2021 Meme Coin Donations

In May 2021, Buterin made headlines by donating or burning over \$1 billion worth of meme coins that had been sent to his wallet:

| Token | Amount Donated | Recipient | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| **SHIB (Shiba Inu)** | \$1B+ | India COVID-Crypto Relief Fund | Largest, but illiquid |
| **AKITA** | \$430M | Gitcoin Grants | Sold over time |
| **Various others** | \$200M+ | Various charities | Burned remainder |

**Important context**: These donations were primarily in highly illiquid tokens. The India COVID relief fund ultimately realized only a fraction of the headline value due to market impact when selling. The "donation" is better understood as a complex event involving unsolicited token transfers, market dynamics, and partial liquidation.

## Balvi: Buterin's Philanthropic Vehicle

In 2021, Buterin established **Balvi** as his primary philanthropic organization, initially focused on COVID-19 response and later expanding to broader causes.

### Balvi Focus Areas

| Area | Annual Funding | Examples |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Pandemic preparedness** | \$10M+ | Biosecurity research, early warning systems |
| **AI safety** | \$5M+ | Research grants, org support |
| **Longevity** | \$5M+ | Anti-aging research |
| **Crypto public goods** | \$5M+ | Gitcoin, infrastructure |

### Notable Balvi Grants

- \$5M to UVC air disinfection research
- \$2M to rapid COVID test development
- Multiple grants to biosecurity organizations
- Support for credential and identity research

| Philanthropist | Annual Giving | Net Worth | Annual Rate |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Vitalik Buterin** | \$50M | \$500M | **10%** |
| **<EntityLink id="jaan-tallinn">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink>** | \$50M | \$500M | **10%** |
| **<EntityLink id="dustin-moskovitz">Dustin Moskovitz</EntityLink>** | \$700M | \$17B | **4%** |
| **<EntityLink id="elon-musk-philanthropy">Elon Musk</EntityLink>** | \$250M | \$400B | **0.06%** |

Buterin's giving rate as a percentage of net worth is among the highest of any major tech philanthropist.

## Views on AI Risk

Buterin has expressed nuanced views on AI risk, generally acknowledging significant concerns while not fully aligning with either "doomer" or "accelerationist" positions:

- Supports AI safety research funding
- Has discussed concerns about AI concentration and monopolization
- Advocates for decentralized AI development approaches
- Interested in crypto-AI intersections (verification, alignment incentives)

In a 2023 blog post, Buterin discussed how blockchain technology might help with AI alignment through mechanisms like commitment devices and transparent auditing.

## Key Uncertainties

| Uncertainty | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **ETH price volatility** | Net worth and giving capacity fluctuate significantly |
| **Balvi's long-term direction** | Will it expand or remain focused? |
| **AI safety prioritization** | Will allocation increase as AI advances? |
| **Regulatory environment** | Crypto regulations could affect wealth and giving |
| **Direct vs. institutional** | Balance between personal grants and established orgs |
