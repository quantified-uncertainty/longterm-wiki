## Overview

EA Global (EAG) is a series of selective conferences organized by the <EntityLink id="cea">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink> (CEA) that connects people committed to effective altruism principles to collaborate on addressing global challenges.[^1] These weekend-long events target students, professionals, policymakers, and researchers with a solid understanding of EA ideas who are taking significant actions based on them, such as working on EA-inspired projects, pursuing EA-aligned careers, or volunteering for EA organizations.[^2]

The conferences serve as a hub for the EA community to engage in talks, workshops, and discussions on evidence-based approaches to high-impact cause areas including global health and development, animal welfare, long-term risks like AI safety and biosecurity, and other pressing global challenges.[^3] Attendees describe EA Global as a place to meet "extremely committed, compassionate" individuals focused on long-term impact evaluation, with many finding co-founders for high-impact charities at these events.[^4]

EA Global conferences are run centrally by CEA's Events team, which handles content selection, admissions, and production. Applications are curated and reviewed within two weeks, with approved applicants required to purchase tickets or make donations.[^5] The events have grown significantly since their inception, with most talks recorded and transcripts made available on the EA Forum.[^6]

## History

### Founding and Early Years (2013-2015)

The first EA Global event was held in 2013 under the name "Effective Altruism Summit."[^7] This initial conference emerged from the broader context of the effective altruism movement's development, which had begun in the late 2000s with the founding of organizations like Giving What We Can (2009) and GiveWell (2007).[^8]

By 2015, EA Global had expanded to three major events across different continents. The largest of these took place at Google's Mountain View campus and featured prominent speakers including <EntityLink id="elon-musk">Elon Musk</EntityLink>, Stuart J. Russell, and William MacAskill.[^9] These early conferences covered topics spanning global poverty, animal advocacy, career workshops, and local chapter development. According to MacAskill, the events demonstrated improved coordination and diversity within the movement.[^10]

The 2015 conferences also included events in Oxford and Melbourne, establishing EA Global's presence across North America, Europe, and Australia. This geographic expansion reflected the movement's growing international reach and CEA's commitment to building a global community around effective altruism principles.[^11]

### Growth and Development (2016-2023)

Following the successful 2015 conferences, EA Global became an annual series with multiple events per year. The conferences maintained their focus on connecting EA community members for high-level discussions while expanding their scope to address emerging priorities within the movement.[^12]

During this period, CEA also introduced EAGx conferences as a complement to the main EA Global series. Unlike the centrally-organized EA Global events, EAGx conferences are community-led with CEA providing support and funding, including tools like event apps. The relationship between EA Global and EAGx is often compared to TED and TEDx—EA Global serves as the flagship, globally-focused event with experienced EA practitioners, while EAGx events target broader, more regional audiences and are more welcoming to newcomers exploring EA ideas.[^13]

The conferences increasingly emphasized networking and one-on-one meetings as core components of the experience. CEA introduced apps like Swapcard to facilitate meeting scheduling and networking among attendees.[^14] This reflected a growing recognition that interpersonal connections and career development were as valuable as formal presentations for many participants.

### Recent Events (2024-2026)

Recent EA Global conferences have continued to emphasize cross-cause collaboration and direct engagement with experienced practitioners. EA Global: Boston 2024, held November 1-3 at the Hynes Convention Center, exemplified this approach with its focus on one-on-one meetings and discussions spanning multiple cause areas.[^15]

Upcoming events include EA Global: New York City 2025 (with applications closing September 28, 2025), EA Global: San Francisco (February 13-15, 2026), EA Global: London (May 29-31, 2026), and EA Global: New York City (October 16-18, 2026).[^16] These events continue to focus on the full range of EA cause areas including farmed animal welfare, global health and development, biosecurity, and AI safety.[^17]

The conferences have maintained their selective admission process, requiring applicants to demonstrate solid understanding of EA principles and significant engagement with EA-aligned work. Typical schedules include a Friday evening reception followed by full days on Saturday and Sunday, concluding around 6pm on Sunday.[^18]

## Conference Structure and Activities

### Format and Schedule

EA Global events typically span three days, beginning with a Friday evening reception and continuing through full days on Saturday and Sunday.[^19] The conferences combine multiple formats including keynote talks, panel discussions, workshops, one-on-one meetings, and social activities.[^20]

The events emphasize networking and direct engagement as much as formal presentations. Attendees can schedule one-on-one meetings through apps like Swapcard, allowing for targeted conversations about specific projects, career paths, or research questions.[^21] This structure reflects the conferences' dual purpose of knowledge sharing and community building.

Most talks at EA Global are recorded and made available online with transcripts posted to the EA Forum, extending the reach of presentations beyond attendees.[^22] Topics have included technical discussions of <EntityLink id="alignment">AI alignment</EntityLink> by researchers like Rohin Shah, strategic considerations about AI safety approaches by speakers like Robert Miles, and broader discussions of cause prioritization and movement strategy.[^23]

### Target Audience and Selectivity

EA Global targets a selective audience of people who have moved beyond basic familiarity with EA concepts to taking concrete actions based on EA principles. CEA's Events team reviews applications to ensure attendees are either professionally engaged in EA-aligned work or planning serious career moves in this direction.[^24]

This selectivity serves to maintain the conferences as venues for substantive discussions among committed practitioners rather than introductory events. Applicants describe being drawn to EA Global as an opportunity to meet other "extremely committed, compassionate" individuals working on similar challenges, with many specifically seeking potential co-founders or collaborators for high-impact projects.[^25]

For those newer to EA or seeking less selective events, the EAGx conference series provides more accessible alternatives with broader regional audiences and lower barriers to entry.[^26]

## Relationship to the Effective Altruism Movement

### Community Building and Networking

EA Global serves as a primary gathering point for the global EA community, which CEA estimates includes approximately 10,000 engaged individuals across 70 countries.[^27] The conferences facilitate connections that have led to the founding of numerous EA organizations and initiatives.

Attendees consistently cite networking as one of the most valuable aspects of EA Global. Many report finding co-founders for high-impact charities at these events, often through programs like Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation that help translate conference connections into concrete projects.[^28] The emphasis on one-on-one meetings and small-group discussions creates opportunities for these kinds of productive collaborations.

The conferences also play a role in career development within the EA ecosystem. They connect people working on or planning EA-aligned projects with advisors, funders, and potential employers.[^29] This has contributed to career changes impacting an estimated 80 million hours of work directed toward high-impact causes.[^30]

### Cause Area Integration

EA Global conferences address the full spectrum of cause areas within effective altruism, including global health and development, animal welfare, existential risks, AI safety, biosecurity, and meta-EA work.[^31] This cross-cause integration reflects EA's commitment to cause neutrality and evidence-based prioritization rather than predetermined focus areas.

Recent community surveys indicate shifting priorities within EA. In the 2024 Annual Impact Report, 53% of respondents selected AI safety as the most pressing cause area, followed by climate change (12%), animal welfare (9%), and global health (8%).[^32] However, EA Global maintains its broad focus across causes, with speakers and workshops representing diverse perspectives on impact.

This diversity sometimes creates tension within the community. Some participants have noted that certain cause areas like global poverty, which were central to early EA and are supported by robust randomized controlled trial evidence, receive less attention in conference discussions than more speculative priorities like AI safety or longtermism.[^33] EA Global attempts to balance these competing priorities while maintaining space for evidence-based discussions across all major cause areas.

### Research and Evidence Base

EA Global conferences emphasize research grounded in systematic evaluation of interventions. Presentations like Karolina Sarek's "How to do research that matters" at EA Global: London 2019 advocate for preset research processes, clear goals, and combining different types of evidence such as cost-effectiveness analyses and expert opinions.[^34]

The conferences showcase research from organizations like GiveWell, which has used extensive randomized controlled trials to evaluate global health interventions. For example, Cochrane reviews of insecticide-treated bednet distribution have found statistically significant child mortality reductions of 5.53 deaths averted per 1,000 children treated per year.[^35] This evidence base has influenced hundreds of millions of dollars in charitable donations facilitated through EA evaluators.[^36]

However, EA Global also features discussions of cause areas where evidence is less established, including AI safety, biosecurity, and longtermism. This creates ongoing debates within the community about appropriate weighting of strong empirical evidence versus theoretical arguments about expected value in areas with high uncertainty.[^37]

## AI Safety Focus

AI safety has become an increasingly prominent topic at EA Global conferences, particularly in recent years as the effective altruism community has shifted significant attention toward existential risks from advanced AI.[^38] The 2024 EA community survey found that 53% of respondents identified AI safety as the most pressing cause area, making it the clear priority within the movement.[^39]

### AI Safety Content and Speakers

EA Global conferences regularly feature technical presentations on AI alignment and safety. Rohin Shah has presented on AI <EntityLink id="alignment-progress">alignment progress</EntityLink>, covering high-level existential risk arguments, specific risks including human unpreparedness for advanced AI and potential for AI deception, and technical approaches like impact regularization and oracle AI designs.[^40] Robert Miles has spoken about alignment plans and the trade-offs between inaction risk (catastrophe from others developing unaligned AI) and accident risk (problems arising from one's own AI development), as well as the potential for using aligned AI for security hardening.[^41]

These presentations reflect broader debates within the AI safety community about appropriate strategies and the current state of progress. Speakers acknowledge ongoing disagreement about specific sub-questions and debate whether current research outputs are useful or potentially distracting from core challenges.[^42]

### Career Development and Networking

EA Global serves as a key venue for AI safety career development and talent coordination. The conferences connect people interested in AI safety work with organizations like <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="deepmind">DeepMind</EntityLink>, and independent research organizations including <EntityLink id="redwood-research">Redwood Research</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="far-ai">FAR AI</EntityLink>, ARC, and Timaeus.[^43]

However, this creates challenges as these organizations compete for talent while pursuing different approaches to AI safety. Recent EA Forum discussions note that organizations like <EntityLink id="metr">METR</EntityLink> compete with frontier AI labs for the same talent pool, complicating efforts to build independent safety evaluation capacity.[^44]

### Integration with Broader EA Priorities

The prominence of AI safety at EA Global has created some tension within the community. Critics argue that the focus on AI safety and longtermism diverts resources from more evidence-based interventions in areas like global health, where robust randomized controlled trials demonstrate clear impact.[^45] Some have characterized this as a shift from empirical "old EA" centered on GiveWell-style charity evaluation toward more speculative philosophical debates.[^46]

EA Forum discussions reflect ongoing efforts to address this tension. Some participants have proposed dedicated AI risk-branded events separate from EA Global to attract talent from fields like information security and policy who may be unfamiliar with or put off by the EA brand.[^47] However, EA Global has maintained its cross-cause approach while accommodating the community's increasing prioritization of AI safety.

## Criticisms and Concerns

### Systemic Change and Institutional Reform

A persistent criticism of both the effective altruism movement and EA Global is the alleged neglect of institutional and systemic change in favor of direct interventions. Critics argue that EA unjustifiably focuses on individual aid measures like cash transfers or mosquito net distribution rather than addressing root causes such as global capitalist structures or political reform.[^48] This critique extends to EA Global conferences, which critics characterize as emphasizing technical interventions within existing systems rather than transformative institutional change.

Philosophers Lisa Herzog and Amia Srinivasan have argued that EA's core commitments are often misinterpreted as rejecting moral reasons for institutional reform, but that this interpretation is incorrect—EA principles do not inherently preclude systemic change, and expected value estimation can apply to institutional interventions as well as direct aid.[^49] However, critics maintain that EA's practical focus remains heavily weighted toward measurable direct interventions.

### Community Culture and Insularity

Internal EA Forum discussions have identified significant cultural weaknesses within the EA community that are reflected at EA Global conferences. These include groupthink, "holier than thou" attitudes, excessive focus on internal community dynamics rather than external impact, and insularity.[^50] The conferences are described as sometimes creating echo chambers where participants reinforce existing views rather than engaging with outside perspectives.

Specific concerns include EA Global being "not media-savvy" and failing to engage effectively with the broader world beyond the EA community.[^51] Some participants note that the events can feel insular, with attendees too focused on the EA community itself as a status symbol rather than on actual impact. The selectivity of EA Global, while intended to ensure substantive discussions, may contribute to this insularity by limiting exposure to diverse perspectives.

### Prioritization and Funding Concerns

Critics have raised concerns about how EA Global reflects and reinforces potentially problematic prioritization within the effective altruism movement. The emphasis on longtermism and existential risks has been criticized for diverting resources from immediate suffering, with critics arguing that prioritizing the productivity of rich countries over aid to the Global South reflects a bias toward plutocrats and tech elites.[^52]

The 2024 EA community survey showed global health receiving interest from 36% of respondents but only 8% selecting it as most pressing, while AI safety dominated at 53%.[^53] Critics note that global poverty leads actual funding from organizations like <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> and Giving What We Can, but elite discussions at conferences like EA Global disproportionately favor speculative cause areas over empirically validated interventions.[^54]

Some have criticized specific funding decisions highlighted at EA Global events, such as Coefficient Giving's \$55 million allocation to the <EntityLink id="cset">Center for Security and Emerging Technology</EntityLink> (CSET), which was characterized as misaligned with transformative AI priorities.[^55] More broadly, critics argue that EA Global lacks a central hub for discussing funding needs across EA organizations, leading to scattered information and missed opportunities.[^56]

### Scandal and Ethical Concerns

The association between effective altruism and Sam Bankman-Fried's fraud has raised questions about EA's culture and values. Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison, was closely connected to the EA movement and CEA received \$13.9 million in grants from the FTX Future Fund.[^57] Critics argue this reveals "deeper rot" within EA, with the movement's emphasis on world-historical importance potentially justifying immoral actions by inflating adherents' sense of their own significance.[^58]

Defenders counter that scandals involving outliers like Bankman-Fried do not reveal fundamental problems with EA principles, and that the movement's focus on evidence and transparency distinguishes it from ideological movements that have justified harmful actions.[^59] However, the controversy has prompted ongoing discussions within the EA community about ethics, culture, and accountability that are reflected in EA Global discussions.

### Exclusion of Local Voices

Critics from the Global South have argued that EA Global and the broader EA movement perpetuate problematic dynamics by excluding local voices and lived experiences. In regions like Uganda's Busoga, EA interventions such as \$100 business grants or bednet distribution are seen as disposable and failing to catalyze self-sustainable change.[^60] The conferences themselves, while international in scope, are primarily organized and attended by people from Western countries, with no African-led organizations among EA's top-rated charities despite EA's focus on African poverty.[^61]

This critique extends to the structure of EA Global itself, which requires financial resources to attend and emphasizes Western academic and professional norms in its application process and event format. Critics argue this perpetuates global inequities in knowledge production and decision-making about interventions affecting the Global South.[^62]

## Funding and Organizational Support

EA Global conferences are funded and organized by the Centre for Effective Altruism, which provides comprehensive support including content selection, speaker recruitment, venue logistics, admissions processing, and production.[^63] Approved applicants are required to purchase tickets or make donations, providing additional funding for the events.[^64]

While specific budget figures for EA Global are not publicly detailed, the conferences are part of CEA's broader portfolio of community-building work. CEA has provided grants for community building since 2018 and launched a university groups accelerator in 2022.[^65] The organization's Events team handles multiple conferences per year across different continents, representing a significant operational undertaking.

Recent developments in EA funding include Coefficient Giving's launch of the Abundance and Growth Fund with \$120 million over three years for economic growth and scientific progress, as well as updated programs for effective giving and careers.[^66] GiveWell has moved over \$1 billion to effective charities and saved an estimated 150,000+ lives through malaria prevention and other global health interventions.[^67]

## Recent Developments and Future Directions

### 2024-2025 Activities

EA Global: Boston 2024, held November 1-3, exemplified recent conference priorities with its emphasis on cross-cause collaboration and networking through one-on-one meetings.[^68] The event continued the tradition of bringing together practitioners across global health, animal welfare, AI safety, and other cause areas for substantive discussions about evidence-based impact.

The 2024 Annual Impact Report showed continued growth in EA community engagement, with 34% of surveyed community members changing donation destinations due to EA principles and 18% donating more than 10% of income to EA causes.[^69] The conferences play a central role in this community development, facilitating the connections and career changes that translate EA principles into action.

### Upcoming Events and Plans

Multiple EA Global conferences are scheduled for 2025-2026, including events in New York City (September 2025 and October 2026), San Francisco (February 2026), and London (May 2026).[^70] These events will continue to address the full range of EA cause areas while adapting to the community's evolving priorities and the changing landscape of global challenges.

EAGx events are also expanding, with EAGxAustralasia 2025 scheduled for November 28-30, 2025 in Melbourne as the ninth annual EA conference in Australia.[^71] This growth in regional events reflects efforts to make EA Global's benefits more accessible while maintaining the flagship conferences' focus on experienced practitioners.

### Organizational Updates

Recent organizational developments in the EA ecosystem include new initiatives from major funders and research organizations. Coefficient Giving launched an RFP for effective giving initiatives with an application deadline of April 20, 2025, and GiveWell has created resources responding to US government foreign assistance policy changes.[^72] These developments will likely influence discussions at upcoming EA Global conferences.

Organizations represented at EA Global continue to expand their work. Anima International opened speaker registration for the 10th Conference on Animal Rights in Europe (CARE) 2025, and the Fish Welfare Initiative published new monitoring and evaluation plans.[^73] The Happy Lives Institute released research finding that top EA-recommended charities are approximately 1,000 times more impactful than the least effective charities when measured in Wellbeing-Years (WELLBYs).[^74]

## Key Uncertainties

- **Long-term impact measurement**: While EA Global facilitates numerous connections and career changes, the ultimate impact of these networking effects on global welfare remains difficult to quantify precisely.

- **Optimal balance between cause areas**: The appropriate distribution of attention and resources between well-evidenced interventions (global health) and more speculative but potentially high-impact causes (AI safety, longtermism) continues to be debated within the community.

- **Scalability and accessibility**: It remains unclear whether EA Global's selective model or broader EAGx events are more effective for movement growth and whether current formats adequately include diverse global perspectives.

- **Community culture sustainability**: Whether EA Global and similar events can address concerns about insularity, groupthink, and exclusion of non-Western voices while maintaining substantive discussions among committed practitioners is uncertain.

- **Integration with mainstream institutions**: The extent to which EA Global should remain a community-focused event versus seeking broader influence in mainstream policy, philanthropy, and research institutions is an open question.
