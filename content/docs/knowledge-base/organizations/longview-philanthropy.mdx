## Overview

[Longview Philanthropy](https://www.longview.org/) is a philanthropic advisory and grantmaking organization founded in 2018 by Natalie Cargill that has become one of the most significant funders and donor advisors in the longtermist ecosystem. As of late 2025, the organization has [directly influenced or moved over \$140 million](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WRGBW8DMNhRGWA9xB/longview-is-now-offering-ai-grant-recommendations-to-donors-1) toward reducing existential risk, with [\$89 million specifically directed to AI risk reduction](https://www.longview.org/artificial-intelligence/) and \$50 million moved in 2025 alone supporting more than 50 projects.

The organization operates across three interconnected modes:

1. **UHNW Donor Advisory**: Bespoke end-to-end services for donors giving over \$1 million annually, including education, expert introductions, grant recommendations, due diligence, and impact assessment
2. **Public Fund Management**: Operating the [Emerging Challenges Fund](https://www.longview.org/fund/emerging-challenges-fund/) (open to all donors) and the [Nuclear Weapons Policy Fund](https://www.longview.org/fund/nuclear-weapons-policy-fund/)
3. **Private Grantmaking**: Managing the [Frontier AI Fund](https://www.longview.org/fund/frontier-ai-fund/) (raised \$13M, disbursed \$11.1M in first 9 months) and bespoke donor-advised grants

Longview fills a critical niche in the longtermist funding landscape by serving donors who want more personalized guidance than pooled funds provide but lack the capacity for independent evaluation. Unlike many EA organizations, Longview's [operational costs are fully funded by a group of philanthropists](https://www.longview.org/about/) who have no influence over grant recommendations, ensuring independence. The organization transitioned from being a project within Effective Ventures Foundation to [operating as independent legal entities](https://www.longview.org/organisational-structure/) in both the UK (Longview Inc. Ltd) and US (Longview Philanthropy USA Inc.).

Longview's core focus areas are AI safety and governance (primary), biosecurity (strengthening defense-focused biotechnologies), and nuclear weapons policy (opposing destabilizing systems and arms races). Their work aims to reduce the risk of global catastrophe from emerging technologies and ensure future generations inherit a safe world.

## Relationship to Other Funders

### Position in the Longtermist Funding Ecosystem

| Funder | Relationship with Longview |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **<EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink>** | Primary operational funder (\$21M+); complementary grantmaking serving different donor types |
| **SFF (Survival and Flourishing Fund)** | Parallel funder; Longview targets gaps SFF doesn't fill |
| **LTFF (Long-Term Future Fund)** | May recommend to clients; serves smaller donors |
| **Founders Pledge** | Similar model but different donor base; some staff crossover (Christian Ruhl) |
| **Manifund** | Regranting platform; complementary mechanism |

### How Longview Complements Other Funders

Longview explicitly [targets grants that major donors like Coefficient Giving are unwilling or unable to make](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZuRmENHzmivjxNafG/longview-s-emerging-challenges-fund-can-effectively-absorb), minimizing displacement effects:

| Niche | Longview's Role |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Speed** | Can move faster than large foundations on time-sensitive opportunities |
| **Political Funding** | Greater flexibility for advocacy and political work |
| **Small Grants** | Makes grants too small for OP's cost-effectiveness threshold |
| **Donor Activation** | Brings new capital into longtermism that wouldn't otherwise flow |
| **International** | US-China dialogue, Nordic philanthropy mobilization |

## Methodology

### Grant Evaluation Framework

Longview applies an [ITN (Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness) framework](https://www.longview.org/grantmaking/) adapted for existential risk:

| Criterion | Description | Key Questions |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Impact Potential** | Expected value of success weighted by probability | What's the upside if this works? How likely is success? |
| **Neglectedness** | Funding gap relative to optimal allocation | Would this get funded anyway? By whom? |
| **Tractability** | Whether additional funding helps | Can money solve this? What's the bottleneck? |
| **Team Quality** | Organizational capacity and track record | Have they delivered before? Do they have the right skills? |
| **Counterfactual** | What happens without this grant | What's the marginal value of Longview's funding? |
| **Speed Sensitivity** | Time-criticality of the opportunity | Does waiting cost impact? |

### Due Diligence Process

| Stage | Activities | Timeline |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Screening** | Initial opportunity review, quick assessment | Days |
| **Investigation** | Deep organizational analysis, financials review | 1-4 weeks |
| **Expert Consultation** | Domain expert calls, reference checks | 1-2 weeks |
| **Site Visits** | In-person meetings when warranted | As needed |
| **Internal Review** | Team discussion, challenge process | 1 week |
| **Recommendation** | Final analysis and ranking for donor | Ongoing |
| **Post-Grant Monitoring** | Progress reports, outcome assessment | 6-month cycles |

### Grantmaking Philosophy

[According to GWWC's evaluation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PTHskHoNpcRDZtJoh/gwwc-s-evaluations-of-evaluators): "Longview has solid grantmaking processes in place to find highly cost-effective funding opportunities. In the grants we evaluated, we generally saw these processes working as intended."

Longview emphasizes:
- **Flexibility**: Can fund advocacy, political work, and controversial areas major foundations avoid
- **Speed**: Faster decision-making than large institutional funders
- **Gap-filling**: Explicitly targets opportunities OP and others can't or won't fund
- **Donor alignment**: Recommendations tailored to individual donor values and risk tolerance

## Critical Assessment

### Strengths

| Strength | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **Deep Expertise** | Dedicated teams for AI, nuclear, biosecurity; staff from Carnegie, GovAI, Epoch |
| **Personalization** | Bespoke advisory for UHNW donors vs. one-size-fits-all recommendations |
| **Independence** | [Operational costs separately funded](https://www.longview.org/about/); no commission model |
| **Network Access** | Retreats with Coefficient Giving, FHI, DeepMind; Nordic philanthropist convening |
| **Research Quality** | [GWWC: "solid grantmaking processes"](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PTHskHoNpcRDZtJoh/gwwc-s-evaluations-of-evaluators) |
| **Gap-Filling** | Targets opportunities too small/controversial for OP |
| **Speed** | Faster than institutional foundations on time-sensitive opportunities |

### Limitations

| Limitation | Context |
|------------|---------|
| **Scale** | \$50M/year vs. Coefficient Giving's \$500M+; still building capacity |
| **Donor Concentration** | Dependent on small number of UHNW clients |
| **Coefficient Dependency** | \$21M+ in operational support from Coefficient Giving |
| **Visibility** | Less public profile than OP, SFF, or LTFF |
| **Staff Size** | ≈15-20 staff limits simultaneous investigations |

### Criticisms and Controversies

**Governance History**: Longview was [previously a project within Effective Ventures Foundation](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/o6LNeNoHBA7Bv9kGE/bad-omens-in-current-ea-governance), the legal entity housing CEA, 80,000 Hours, and EA Funds. A December 2022 post raised concerns about EVF's governance structure. Longview has since [transitioned to independent legal entities](https://www.longview.org/organisational-structure/).

**Political Expertise Concerns**: A [June 2025 EA Forum post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fveRS7iTK83KKW3my/political-funding-expertise-post-6-of-7-on-ai-governance) raised concerns about grantmaker expertise in political advocacy:

> "In June 2025, Longview Philanthropy advertised an opening for an AI policy expert. However, these efforts are too modest and too recent to fully address the problem. It takes more than one or two experts to adequately evaluate an entire field's worth of advocacy proposals."

The post recommended Longview ensure new positions are filled by people with advocacy backgrounds, not just AI governance research experience.

**Digital Sentience Fund Skepticism**: One [EA Forum commenter noted](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/s8gS2Lh39usPJgJeL/should-you-donate-through-funds): "I do not endorse Longview's Digital Sentience Fund... I expect it'll fund misc empirical and philosophical 'digital sentience' work plus unfocused field-building."

### The Donor Advisory Model: Benefits and Risks

| Dimension | Benefits | Risks |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Donor Activation** | Brings new capital into longtermism | May create dependency on advisor recommendations |
| **Personalization** | Aligns grants with donor values | Could fragment funding toward idiosyncratic preferences |
| **Independence** | No commission means no incentive to maximize AUM | Heavy OP funding creates potential conflicts |
| **Speed** | Faster than institutional foundations | Less time for thorough due diligence |
| **Flexibility** | Can fund political/controversial work | Less public accountability than traditional foundations |
