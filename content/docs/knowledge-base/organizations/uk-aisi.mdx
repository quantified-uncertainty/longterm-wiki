## Overview

The UK AI Safety Institute (UK AISI) is a government organization established in November 2023 to advance AI safety through research, evaluation, and <EntityLink id="international-coordination">international coordination</EntityLink>. Created in the wake of the first AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park, AISI represents the UK's commitment to being a global leader in AI safety and governance. In February 2025, the organization was renamed the **AI Security Institute** to reflect a sharper focus on national security threats including cyberattacks, fraud, and AI-enabled bioweapon development.

As one of the first government bodies specifically dedicated to advanced AI safety (alongside the US AISI), the UK AISI plays a pioneering role in translating AI safety research into government policy and practice. The organization conducts technical research on AI risks, evaluates frontier models for dangerous capabilities, develops safety standards, and coordinates international efforts through the International Network of <EntityLink id="ai-safety-institutes">AI Safety Institutes</EntityLink>, which now includes 10+ member countries.

The UK AISI's strategic positioning reflects the UK government's ambition: to be a global hub for AI safety, bridging technical research communities, frontier AI labs, and international policymakers. Chair Ian Hogarth has described AISI as a "startup inside the government" that combines technical rigor with policy influence.

Technology Secretary Peter Kyle announced the change at the Munich Security Conference, emphasizing a pivot from concerns about bias and misinformation toward risks such as cyberattacks, fraud, and AI-enabled bioweapon development. The Institute has launched a new criminal misuse team in partnership with the Home Office to investigate AI's role in serious crimes including child exploitation, cybercrime, and financial fraud.

## Core Functions and Activities

### 1. Frontier Model Evaluations

The Institute independently assesses advanced AI systems for dangerous capabilities across domains critical to national security and public safety. In their April 2024 evaluation of publicly available frontier models, AISI found several concerning capabilities:

| Evaluation Domain | Key Findings (April 2024) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Cybersecurity** | Models capable of completing basic to intermediate cybersecurity challenges |
| **Chemistry/Biology** | Several models demonstrated PhD-equivalent level of knowledge |
| **Safeguards** | Built-in safeguards vulnerable to even basic "jailbreaks" |
| **Autonomous Systems** | Models performed better than biology PhD experts on open-ended questions |

**Methodology:** The Institute has built evaluation expertise by learning from and collaborating with organizations like <EntityLink id="metr">METR</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="apollo-research">Apollo Research</EntityLink>, and ARC. Their approach includes both pre-deployment and post-deployment testing, with a focus on red-teaming and adversarial evaluation techniques.

**Lab cooperation:** AISI has established voluntary agreements with OpenAI, <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>, and Google DeepMind for pre-release access to models. Labs share safety-relevant information under NDAs, coordinate on safety thresholds, and collaborate on evaluation methodology development.

**Inspect AI Framework:** In May 2024, AISI open-sourced Inspect AI, a Python framework for building and running reproducible LLM evaluations. The framework has been adopted by major AI labs including Anthropic, DeepMind, and xAI. Inspect AI includes over 100 pre-built evaluations, a web-based visualization tool, and support for tool calling and multi-agent evaluations. Key benchmarks include ChemBench (2,786 chemistry questions), Humanity's Last Exam (3,000 questions across dozens of subjects), and Cybench (40 professional-level cybersecurity challenges).

### 2. Research Funding Programs

AISI manages substantial external research funding, making it one of the largest funders of AI safety research globally. The Institute's grant programs combine government funding with partnerships from industry and philanthropy.

| Program | Total Funding | Per-Project Range | Focus Areas |

### On UK AI Policy

AISI provides technical expertise directly to Parliament and ministers, informing risk assessments for policy decisions and shaping the framework for UK AI regulation. Key policy inputs include the Online Safety Act AI provisions, AI White Paper consultation responses, regulatory framework development, and national security AI strategy.

### On Industry Practices

AISI's evaluation methods are becoming industry standard. Major labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind) have entered voluntary agreements for pre-deployment testing, with Inspect AI being adopted as the evaluation framework of choice. This has normalized pre-deployment safety assessment, increased transparency requirements, and established red-teaming as standard practice.

### On International AI Safety

The UK is now recognized as a global leader in AI safety convening. Concrete outcomes include the Bletchley Declaration (first international agreement on AI risks), the International Network of AI Safety Institutes (10+ member countries), shared evaluation methodologies through Inspect AI, the International Scientific Report on AI Safety (led by Turing Award winner Yoshua Bengio), and foundation for ongoing governance discussions at summits in Seoul and Paris.

## Criticisms and Challenges

### The 2025 Rebrand Controversy

The February 2025 renaming from "AI Safety Institute" to "AI Security Institute" drew significant criticism from the AI safety community. AI Now Institute noted that the change signals the institute "will no longer focus on AI ethical issues, such as algorithm bias or protecting freedom of speech in AI applications." Critics worry this represents a narrowing of scope away from broader societal harms toward a purely national security focus.

**Defenders argue** the rebrand reflects AISI's actual priorities from the beginning, with Ian Hogarth emphasizing that "this change of name better reflects the team's essential remit and the priorities that they have always focused on."

### Can Government Keep Pace?

AI capabilities advance faster than government institutions can respond. AISI faces structural challenges including bureaucratic constraints on hiring speed, difficulty matching private sector salaries (despite being competitive within civil service), limited compute resources compared to lab budgets, and inevitable evaluation lag behind the frontier.

**AISI's response** has been to operate as a "startup inside government" with fast-track hiring, partnerships with academic and private sector organizations, and focus on high-impact evaluation work rather than trying to match lab resources directly.

### Regulatory Capture Risk

There are concerns that AISI might be captured by industry interests given its dependence on voluntary lab cooperation, the information asymmetry favoring labs, and the revolving door between government and industry. However, mitigations include government independence, diverse expertise sourcing (not only from labs), public interest mandate, parliamentary oversight, and increasing transparency.

### International Coordination Challenges

China's absence from Western AI safety coordination remains a significant limitation. The International Network of AI Safety Institutes includes primarily democratic allies, with no clear pathway to engaging China despite early participation in the Bletchley Declaration. This creates risks of fragmented governance and potential race dynamics.

### Resources and Scope

With an annual budget of approximately 50 million GBP, AISI remains smaller than major lab research budgets and must prioritize carefully. The Institute cannot evaluate everything and depends heavily on partnerships. Maintaining quality and credibility while scaling remains an ongoing challenge.

<KeyQuestions questions={[
  "Can UK maintain global leadership in AI safety long-term?",
  "Will voluntary lab cooperation be sufficient or is regulation needed?",
  "How to coordinate internationally without China participation?",
  "Can government evaluation keep pace with frontier AI development?",
  "What enforcement mechanisms should back UK AI safety standards?",
  "How to balance UK national interests with international cooperation?"
