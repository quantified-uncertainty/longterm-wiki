## Overview

The **Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)** is a philanthropic organization founded in December 2015 by Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. Structured as a limited liability company rather than a traditional nonprofit foundation, CZI pledged 99% of the couple's Facebook shares—initially valued at \$45 billion and now exceeding \$200 billion—to advance human potential and equality.[^1]

CZI's original mission encompassed diverse areas including health, education, scientific research, criminal justice reform, immigration, and housing affordability. However, the organization underwent a dramatic strategic shift in 2025-2026, refocusing almost exclusively on AI-powered biological research to "cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the year 2100."[^2] This pivot involved winding down social advocacy programs, cutting diversity and equity initiatives, and doubling down on the Biohub network—a collaborative research infrastructure bringing together scientists, engineers, and AI experts.[^3]

The initiative operates through multiple entities including the CZI LLC, CZI Foundation, donor-advised funds, and CZI Advocacy. Its LLC structure enables flexibility for both grants to nonprofits and investments in for-profit companies, though this approach has drawn criticism regarding accountability and tax implications.[^4] As of 2025, CZI announced plans to spend at least \$10 billion on basic scientific research over the next decade—more than double its first-decade spending—matching the annual budget of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.[^5]

## History

### Founding and Initial Commitments

CZI launched on December 1, 2015, coinciding with the birth of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's first daughter.[^6] The announcement came in the form of a letter to their newborn, pledging to donate 99% of their Facebook shares over their lifetimes to advance human potential and equality. Chan's background as the daughter of Chinese immigrant refugees from Vietnam, combined with her experience as a pediatrician serving vulnerable children, shaped the initiative's early focus on education, immigration reform, and health care.[^7]

The decision to structure CZI as an LLC rather than a traditional charitable foundation was controversial from the outset. According to critics, this structure allowed the founders to retain control over Facebook shares, make political contributions, invest in for-profit companies, and avoid the disclosure obligations that apply to traditional foundations.[^8] Supporters argued the LLC model provided necessary flexibility to pursue impact through multiple channels—grants, investments, and policy advocacy—while committing to reinvest any profits into the mission.[^9]

### Early Initiatives (2016-2020)

**2016** marked CZI's first major initiatives. The organization co-founded The Primary School, a nonprofit offering free K-12 education, prenatal care, early childhood education, and primary health care in East Palo Alto, California, with Priscilla Chan serving as emeritus board chair.[^10] In September 2016, CZI co-led a \$50 million funding round for Indian education startup Byju's alongside Sequoia Capital and other investors.[^11]

**2017** saw CZI's first acquisition: Meta, a Toronto-based AI scientific literature search engine designed to help scientists discover and share research (the service was later shut down in March 2022).[^12] CZI also became a founding sponsor of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Toronto and launched the Chan Zuckerberg Community Fund to support over 200 local nonprofits providing safety-net services like food, housing, and emergency assistance.[^13]

**2018** brought the launch of Opportunity Insights, an economic mobility research initiative led by economists Raj Chetty, John Friedman, and Nathaniel Hendren.[^14] The same period saw substantial investments in personalized learning platforms and education technology, including the Summit Learning Platform designed to accelerate student learning through computer-based education.

**2020** was marked by significant challenges and controversies. In June, a group of Black employees sent a letter to Priscilla Chan accusing the organization of failing to uphold commitments to diversity, inclusion, and equity.[^15] Former employee Gerardo Holgado filed a formal complaint alleging CZI fostered a non-inclusive environment where Black employees were underpaid, undervalued, and marginalized, while leadership responded defensively to concerns.[^16] During the COVID-19 pandemic, CZI provided major grants for Bay Area testing infrastructure through a Biohub-Stanford-UCSF collaboration and contributed to the Therapeutics Accelerator alongside the Gates Foundation, Wellcome, and Mastercard.[^17]

### The Biohub Network and Scientific Expansion (2016-2025)

The Chan Zuckerberg Biohub represents CZI's flagship scientific initiative. Launched in 2016 with an initial \$600 million investment from a \$3 billion science pledge, the Biohub fosters collaboration between UC San Francisco, UC Berkeley, and Stanford researchers.[^18] The network has since expanded to include institutes in Chicago and New York, with all four institutes fully operational by 2024.[^19]

CZI's science program has supported more than 8,000 publications since its founding.[^20] Key research areas include neurodegenerative disease mechanisms through the Neurodegeneration Challenge Network, single-cell biology and data science, and open source software for scientific computing.[^21] Notable achievements include funding for preprint repositories (bioRxiv, medRxiv, ASAPbio) that reach over twelve million monthly readers from 140+ countries,[^22] and supporting over 200 open-source tools used by millions of researchers, including foundational packages like NumPy, scikit-learn, and SciPy.[^23]

In 2024, the Biohub Chicago team published breakthrough research in *Science* on an implantable device capable of tracking protein levels in real-time in animals, enabling early disease detection and prevention.[^24] The same year saw the launch of the Center for Pediatric CRISPR Cures in collaboration with the Innovative Genomics Institute, focusing on gene-editing treatments for children with severe genetic diseases.[^25]

### Strategic Pivot to AI-Biology (2025-2026)

The most dramatic transformation in CZI's history occurred in 2025-2026, when the organization announced it was "going all in" on AI-powered biology. This shift involved several major changes:

- **Mission refinement**: Dropped "managing disease" from the goal of curing, managing, or preventing all diseases by 2100, focusing exclusively on cures and prevention accelerated by AI advances[^26]
- **Funding expansion**: Commitment to spend at least \$10 billion on basic scientific research over the next decade (2026-2036), more than double the \$4-4.5 billion spent in the first decade[^27]
- **Social program wind-down**: Ended grantmaking on social inequities, immigration reform, and community development initiatives that had characterized the organization's first decade[^28]
- **DEI team elimination**: Cancelled the Diverse Slate Practice aimed at ensuring diverse job candidates and cut the diversity, equity, and inclusion team[^29]
- **Workforce restructuring**: Cut approximately 70 jobs (≈8% of workforce) in early 2026 to refocus on AI-biomedical research[^30]

Priscilla Chan, age 40 with three daughters, has articulated a sense of urgency driving these changes: "As I get older, the faster I personally want it to be."[^31] The organization expressed optimism that the "marriage" of AI and biology could achieve disease prevention and cure goals "much sooner" than the end of the century.[^32]

## Scientific Programs and Infrastructure

### AI Computing Infrastructure

CZI has built substantial AI computing infrastructure to support its biological research mission. In 2023-2025, the organization constructed a compute cluster featuring 1,024 NVIDIA H100 GPUs in an NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD configuration, optimized specifically for nonprofit life sciences AI and machine learning training.[^33] The organization plans to expand this infrastructure tenfold to 10,000 GPUs by 2028.[^34]

CZI offers computational resources through competitive research funding announcements, requiring proposals to use at least 96 GPUs and prioritizing work on virtual cells and disease-related applications.[^35] Meta (Facebook) employees are explicitly barred from applying to these programs.[^36]

### Virtual Cells and AI Models

In November 2025, CZI's Biohub announced a major AI-powered biology initiative including the development of a Virtual Immune System—an AI model designed to simulate immune system function for drug development and disease prevention.[^37] The organization released several AI models including:

- **VariantFormer**: For genetic variant analysis
- **CryoLens**: For cryo-electron microscopy image processing
- **scLDM**: For single-cell data modeling[^38]

In February 2025, CZI published research on developing "Virtual Cells" using what they characterized as "safe, ethical, and reliable AI" for biological discovery.[^39] A 2024 preprint in *Cell* outlined a roadmap for virtual cell models with an emphasis on open science principles, developed in collaboration with NVIDIA to scale petabyte-level data processing.[^40]

Additional AI initiatives include the **GREmLN AI model** for cancer genetics, which analyzes key networks to pinpoint cancer cell signatures,[^41] and **rBio**, which uses virtual cells to train AI models without requiring laboratory experiments.[^42]

### Research Focus Areas

CZI's Neurodegeneration Challenge Network funds projects investigating multiple aspects of brain disease, including brain waste clearance during sleep, TDP-43 proteinopathy and immune dysregulation, and microglia protective functions.[^43] The organization also supports single-cell biology and data science through 18-month grants aimed at advancing tools and computational resources for analyzing single-cell datasets.[^44]

The Essential Open Source Software for Science program, developed in partnership with the Kavli Foundation and Wellcome Trust, funds tools designed to make research more accessible.[^45] CZI's support for preprint repositories proved particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic by enabling rapid pre-peer-review sharing of research findings.[^46]

The Rare As One Project has grown from 30 to 94 patient-led rare disease organizations since 2020, with a 2024 report highlighting scientific progress enabled by this network approach.[^47]

## Education Initiatives

### Early Education Focus and Summit Learning

CZI's early education work centered on "personalized learning" approaches, with substantial investments in the Summit Learning Platform—a computer-based education program intended to accelerate learning and raise test scores. The organization provided funding to educational startups including Byju's and Enlearn, participated in a \$12 million partnership with the Gates Foundation, and supported College Board SAT preparation tools.[^48]

In June 2017, CZI announced an ambitious vision to launch a "meaningful number" of schools within five years (by 2022) that would demonstrate dramatically better student performance, engagement, and teacher involvement, with plans for hundreds of millions of dollars in annual education grants.[^49]

### Summit Learning Failure and Strategic Pivot

However, by August 2023, CZI acknowledged that Summit Learning had failed to deliver large learning gains or achieve widespread adoption as hoped. The organization laid off dozens of education team staff and pivoted its strategy, with education head Sandra Liu Huang admitting that prior efforts fell short.[^50] Education critics had argued CZI's approach embodied "skewed values" that defined student potential narrowly through standardized testing, prioritized competition over broader child development, and provided little evidence of achieving stated goals.[^51]

### Current Education Direction

Despite the shift away from social causes, CZI maintains some education programs focused on AI integration. In 2024, the organization launched **Render**, an innovation studio designed to co-build EdTech tools with educators.[^52] CZI continues to provide grants for open-access datasets aimed at improving AI models in education and has developed a Knowledge Graph and AI Evaluators aligned with learning science.[^53]

The Primary School, co-founded by Priscilla Chan in 2016, was scheduled to close in 2026. Chan did not attend closure announcement meetings, leaving parents uncertain about the transition. CZI pledged \$50 million over five years to support parent engagement, early childhood education, and health care in the affected East Palo Alto, Belle Haven, and East Bay communities.[^54]

## Organizational Structure and Approach

### LLC Structure and Entities

CZI operates through multiple legal entities including the CZI LLC (primary entity), CZI Foundation, donor-advised funds at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, and CZI Advocacy.[^55] This structure differs fundamentally from traditional philanthropic foundations in several ways:

- **Profit motive**: Can pursue both nonprofit grants and for-profit investments, with profits reinvested into the mission rather than distributed to owners[^56]
- **Control retention**: Mark Zuckerberg retains control over Facebook shares held by CZI, though the organization publicly lists its grants[^57]
- **Policy advocacy**: Can engage in policy debates and political contributions without the restrictions that apply to 501(c)(3) organizations[^58]
- **Disclosure obligations**: Faces fewer transparency requirements than traditional foundations[^59]

### Funding Philosophy and Approach

CZI characterizes itself as taking a "long-term approach" with a "technology mindset" focused on decade-scale challenges.[^60] The organization emphasizes collaboration, building the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub as a partnership model bringing together multiple universities rather than funding isolated research groups.

The initiative's annual operating budget is approximately \$1 billion.[^61] Beyond basic research, CZI supports infrastructure including preprint servers, open-source software tools, and open data platforms like CELL×GENE and contributions to the Human Cell Atlas.[^62] The organization also funded Every Cure, a nonprofit using AI for drug repurposing that identified 9 opportunities from 75 million possible drug-disease combinations.[^63]

### Key Personnel

**Priscilla Chan** (Co-Founder, Co-CEO) leads biomedical research and technology initiatives, drawing on her background as a pediatrician who worked at San Francisco General Hospital until 2017. She earned her BA in Biology from Harvard University in 2007 and her MD from UC San Francisco in 2012.[^64] Chan has described her family origins—as the daughter of Chinese immigrants who arrived as refugees from Vietnam—as foundational to her focus on education and opportunity.[^65]

**Mark Zuckerberg** (Co-Founder, Co-CEO) provides technical expertise and community-building experience from his role as Meta co-founder, chairman, and CEO. He studied computer science at Harvard University starting in 2002, dropping out in his second year (2004) to focus on Facebook.[^66]

**Marc Malandro** (Chief Operating Officer) previously built CZI's science program and served as VP at the University of Pittsburgh Innovation Institute.[^67]

**Mark Kim** (General Counsel) structured CZI and the Biohub network, bringing experience from his partnership at Munger, Tolles & Olson.[^68]

**Shana Kelley** (President, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago) leads development of implantable biosensor technology for real-time inflammation monitoring.[^69]

**Matthias Haury** (Chief Operating Officer, Biohub and Imaging Institute) oversees the planned 10-fold computing power expansion over the next three years and emphasizes AI's role in scientific collaboration.[^70]

## Relationship to AI Safety and Alignment

Despite substantial investments in artificial intelligence for biological research and education, no evidence indicates CZI has engaged with AI safety, AI alignment, or existential risk concerns. The organization's AI work focuses exclusively on biomedical applications including large-scale AI models for cell biology, virtual immune systems, and drug discovery.[^71]

CZI emphasizes building "safe, ethical, and reliable AI" in the context of virtual cells, but this language refers to biomedical reliability and research ethics rather than concerns about superintelligence, catastrophic risks, or alignment of advanced AI systems with human values.[^72] The organization has funded open-source tools foundational to AI development (NumPy, scikit-learn, SciPy) but not AI safety research organizations or alignment initiatives.[^73]

The absence of engagement with AI safety concerns is notable given:
- Mark Zuckerberg's prominent role in AI development through Meta
- CZI's heavy investment in AI compute infrastructure (1,024 GPUs expanding to 10,000)
- The organization's stated willingness to increase funding if AI reveals pathways to novel applications
- The accelerated timeline for achieving medical goals driven by AI optimism

Within the Effective Altruism community, CZI's cause prioritization has been criticized for showing "virtually no sign" of deep engagement with EA principles, particularly causes emphasized by major EA funders. According to EA Forum discussions, CZI appears only "moderately convinced" of core EA causes like biosecurity and notably diverges from EA priorities including AI risk and animal welfare.[^74]

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Structural and Accountability Concerns

CZI's LLC structure has generated sustained criticism from multiple perspectives. Critics argue this arrangement circumvents public accountability through reduced disclosure requirements compared to traditional foundations, enables secrecy around decision-making processes, and may prioritize extracting data while projecting an image of "corporate social responsibility."[^75] The structure allows political contributions and for-profit investments that would be prohibited for traditional charitable organizations.[^76]

Some commentators view the LLC model as designed to extend patterns seen in Zuckerberg's earlier education reform efforts in Newark, which faced criticism for "actively excluding the public from policy planning" and decision-making.[^77] Broader critiques suggest elite philanthropy of this scale allows the wealthiest individuals to sanitize their economic advantage while increasing their influence over society without meaningful democratic oversight.[^78]

### Racial Discrimination and Workplace Culture

In 2020, former employee Gerardo Holgado filed a complaint alleging CZI fostered a non-inclusive environment where Black employees were underpaid, undervalued, denied growth opportunities, and marginalized. According to the complaint, Black staff who raised concerns were labeled "too assertive" while non-Black employees received preferential treatment.[^79] Holgado stated that CZI "utterly failed to 'build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future' for its Black employees."[^80]

When Holgado raised concerns about CZI's grantmaking operating "devoid of racial analysis," including warnings against centering racial equity in criminal justice reform strategies, his input was dismissed. His 2019 proposals to bring philanthropy executive Edgar Villanueva to speak at CZI were declined twice.[^81] CZI leadership allegedly responded defensively to Black employees' concerns, declined to provide pay equity transparency, and failed to implement employee-proposed action plans, instead assigning a newly hired chief operating officer to develop an alternative approach—a move Holgado characterized as "passing the buck and placating employees with half measures."[^82]

In June 2020, a group of Black employees sent a letter directly to Priscilla Chan reiterating accusations that the organization was failing to uphold commitments to diversity, inclusion, and equity.[^83]

### DEI Rollback and Social Program Wind-Down

In 2025, CZI eliminated its diversity, equity, and inclusion team and cancelled its Diverse Slate Practice, which aimed to ensure diverse candidates for job openings. The organization also informed San Mateo County partners associated with DEI initiatives that their funding would end.[^84] These moves drew sharp criticism from employees and impacted charitable organizations, who characterized the changes as "censoring nonprofits" and "penalizing organizations that recommit to racial justice."[^85]

CZI's broader wind-down of grantmaking on social inequities, housing, criminal justice reform, immigration, and education—a process that began before 2025 but accelerated dramatically—has been interpreted by some observers as distancing the organization from social justice to curry favor with conservative political forces. Some speculate the shift reflects concerns about Meta's antitrust vulnerabilities and right-wing criticism of Zuckerberg's \$400+ million in donations supporting election infrastructure in 2020.[^86]

Grantees described the funding cuts as reflecting poorly on Chan and Zuckerberg's character, particularly given the organization's continued willingness to expand science spending dramatically while eliminating relatively modest social programs.[^87]

### Education Program Criticisms

CZI's education initiatives have faced multiple lines of criticism:

**Philosophical objections**: Critics argue CZI's "personalized learning" approach embodies skewed values that define student potential narrowly through standardized test performance, prioritize individual competition over collaborative learning and broader child development, and operate without clear educational values beyond quantifiable metrics.[^88]

**Displacement concerns**: Education scholars have criticized CZI's technology-centered model for displacing teachers, undermining democratic education, prioritizing data extraction and software development over human labor, and recasting teachers as "mentors" while machines quantify student learning.[^89]

**Effectiveness questions**: The acknowledged failure of Summit Learning to deliver learning gains or achieve widespread adoption undermines CZI's core education theory of change. Critics note there was little evidence the programs were achieving stated goals even before the 2023 pivot.[^90]

**Public participation**: Like Zuckerberg's earlier Newark school reforms, CZI education projects have been criticized for excluding public participation and community input from design and implementation decisions.[^91]

### Political Activity and Conflicts

CZI supported failed 2020 California Proposition 15 (which would have raised large commercial property taxes) and opposed failed Proposition 20 (stricter sentencing and parole laws).[^92] Following these electoral defeats, CZI restructured in 2020 to no longer fund political campaigns directly, though the organization can still engage in policy advocacy through its LLC structure.[^93]

Critics note a tension in CZI addressing social problems—including misinformation, polarization, and mental health issues—that are partly caused or exacerbated by Facebook, the source of the Zuckerberg-Chan fortune.[^94] This dynamic raises questions about whether the philanthropy serves partly to rehabilitate reputational damage from Meta's business practices.

### Data and Privacy Concerns

Questions have been raised about whether CZI's education activities, particularly "personalized learning" platforms, serve to commercialize user data, embed advertising in educational applications, or direct users toward Facebook and its advertising ecosystem.[^95] The organization's research grant applications warn that personal data may be stored outside applicants' countries, with CZI serving as data controller—raising privacy concerns for international researchers.[^96]

## Relationship to Effective Altruism

Within the Effective Altruism community, CZI represents a notable case of substantial wealth directed toward philanthropic goals without apparent deep engagement with EA frameworks. EA Forum participants have debated whether Zuckerberg could have maximized impact by donating to established high-impact organizations like the Gates Foundation, GiveDirectly, and GiveWell-recommended charities rather than founding a new initiative.[^97]

A significant criticism centers on cause selection. According to EA Forum analyses, CZI's priorities show "virtually no sign" that its cause selection reflects engagement with effective altruism principles, particularly regarding causes emphasized by major EA funders like Dustin Moskovitz through Good Ventures and <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink>.[^98] Specifically, CZI appears only "moderately convinced" of core EA causes such as biosecurity and global health interventions, while notably diverging from EA priorities including AI existential risk and animal welfare.[^99]

The decision to structure CZI as an LLC rather than a traditional foundation drew particular skepticism within EA circles, with some viewing it primarily as a public relations move that reduces accountability while claiming philanthropic intent.[^100]

CZI's stated organizational commitment to "diversity, equity, and inclusion" as outlined in its Community Participation Guidelines reflects values that have created internal tensions within the organization.[^101] EA Forum discussions reference the 70+ employee letter requesting more DEI initiatives and reports of individual employees demanding organizational action on content moderation issues related to Facebook.[^102] These dynamics intersect with broader EA community debates about reputation management versus principled action, where detailed discussions about organizational decisions sometimes become diverted into debates about community reputation concerns.[^103]

## Key Uncertainties

Several major questions remain about CZI's trajectory and impact:

**Disease cure timeline feasibility**: CZI's goal to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by 2100 is extraordinarily ambitious. While the organization has dropped "manage" and expressed optimism about AI acceleration, it has not provided specific updated timelines or metrics for evaluating progress toward this goal. The shift from a century-long timeframe to vague references to "coming decades" or "10 years" lacks supporting evidence for why AI advances justify such optimism.

**AI capability assumptions**: CZI's dramatic strategic pivot and funding expansion rest on assumptions about AI's ability to accelerate biological discovery and drug development. The organization's claims that virtual cells and large-scale AI models will transform disease research remain largely unproven. No independent assessments are available of whether CZI's AI infrastructure and approaches represent sound technical bets or overoptimistic projections.

**Opportunity cost of LLC structure**: Whether CZI's LLC structure has enabled impact that would have been impossible through traditional foundations, or whether it primarily serves to reduce accountability and maintain control, remains contested. The organization lists grants publicly but provides less transparency than would be required of a traditional foundation, making comprehensive impact assessment difficult.

**Social program effectiveness**: Little rigorous evidence is available about the effectiveness of CZI's now-discontinued social programs in criminal justice reform, immigration, housing, and community development. The wind-down of these initiatives means outcomes may never be properly evaluated, preventing learning about what worked or failed in these domains.

**Relationship between Meta and CZI**: The extent to which CZI's activities serve to rehabilitate Meta's reputation while addressing problems partly caused by social media platforms, versus pursuing genuinely independent philanthropic goals, is difficult to assess. The political dimensions of CZI's 2025-2026 shift away from social justice causes amid Meta's regulatory challenges add complexity to interpreting the organization's motivations.

**Research translation**: While CZI has supported over 8,000 publications and substantial open science infrastructure, the pathway from basic research funding to actual disease prevention and cures remains unclear. The organization's shift toward clinical research "if AI reveals novel medicines" suggests uncertainty about whether its current approach will generate actionable medical advances.

**Comparative effectiveness**: No comprehensive comparisons exist between CZI's approach and alternative uses of similar resources. Whether \$10+ billion directed toward AI-biology research through CZI represents more or less impact than the same resources allocated through existing biomedical research institutions, distributed to diverse high-impact charities, or deployed through other mechanisms, cannot be determined from available evidence.
