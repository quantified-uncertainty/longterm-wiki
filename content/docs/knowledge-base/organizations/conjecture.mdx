## Overview

Conjecture is an AI safety research organization founded in 2021 by <EntityLink id="connor-leahy">Connor Leahy</EntityLink> and a team of researchers concerned about existential risks from advanced AI. The organization pursues a distinctive technical approach centered on "Cognitive Emulation" (CoEm) - building interpretable AI systems based on human cognition principles rather than aligning existing <EntityLink id="language-models">large language models</EntityLink>.

Based in London with a team of 30-40 researchers, Conjecture raised over \$10M in Series A funding in 2023. Their research agenda emphasizes mechanistic interpretability and understanding neural network internals, representing a fundamental alternative to mainstream <EntityLink id="why-alignment-hard">prosaic alignment approaches</EntityLink> pursued by organizations like <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>.

## Founding and Evolution

### Origins (2021)

Conjecture emerged from the **EleutherAI** collective, an open-source AI research group that successfully recreated GPT-3 as open-source models (GPT-J, GPT-NeoX). Key founding factors:

| Factor | Impact | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| EleutherAI Experience | High | Demonstrated capability replication feasibility |
| Safety Concerns | High | Recognition of risks from capability <EntityLink id="proliferation">proliferation</EntityLink> |
| European Gap | Medium | Limited AI safety ecosystem outside Bay Area |
| Funding Availability | Medium | Growing investor interest in AI safety |

**Philosophical Evolution**: The transition from EleutherAI's "democratize AI" mission to Conjecture's safety-focused approach represents a significant shift in thinking about AI development and publication strategies.

### Funding Trajectory

## Timeline and Risk Estimates

### Leadership Risk Assessments

Conjecture's leadership has articulated clear views on AI timelines and safety approaches, which fundamentally motivate their Cognitive Emulation research agenda and organizational strategy:

| Expert/Source | Estimate | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Connor Leahy | AGI: 2-10 years | Leahy has consistently expressed short AI timeline views across multiple public statements and podcasts from 2023-2024, suggesting transformative AI systems could emerge within years rather than decades. These short timelines create urgency for developing interpretability-first approaches before AGI arrives. |
| Connor Leahy | P(doom): High without major changes | Leahy has expressed significant concern about the default trajectory of AI development in 2023 statements, arguing that prosaic alignment approaches pursued by frontier labs are insufficient to ensure safety. This pessimism about conventional alignment motivates Conjecture's alternative CoEm approach. |
| Conjecture Research | Prosaic alignment: Insufficient | The organization's core research direction reflects a fundamental assessment that post-hoc alignment of large language models through techniques like RLHF and Constitutional AI cannot provide adequate safety guarantees. This view, maintained since founding, drives their pursuit of interpretability-first system design. |
| Organization | Interpretability: Necessary for safety | Conjecture's founding premise holds that mechanistic interpretability is not merely useful but necessary for AI safety verification. This fundamental research assumption distinguishes them from organizations pursuing behavioral safety approaches and shapes their entire technical agenda. |

## Future Scenarios

### Research Trajectory Projections

| Timeline | Optimistic | Realistic | Pessimistic |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **2-3 years** | CoEm demonstrations, policy influence | Continued interpretability advances | Commercial pressure compromises |
| **3-5 years** | Competitive interpretable systems | Mixed results, partial success | Research agenda stagnates |
| **5+ years** | Field adoption of CoEm principles | Portfolio contribution to safety | Marginalized approach |

### Critical Dependencies

| Factor | Importance | Uncertainty |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Technical Feasibility** | Critical | High - unproven at scale |
| **Funding Continuity** | High | Medium - VC expectations |
| **AGI Timeline** | Critical | High - if very short, insufficient time |
| **Field Receptivity** | Medium | Medium - depends on results |
