## Stakeholder Ownership & Philanthropy

The table below shows each stakeholder's estimated equity stake, the fraction pledged to charitable giving ("Pledge %"), the estimated probability those donations go to EA-aligned causes ("EA Align %"), and two derived columns: expected donated dollars and expected EA-effective giving. All values scale automatically with the current valuation.

**Total funding raised**: <F e="anthropic" f="226cc0eb" /> across 16 rounds. **Current valuation**: <F e="anthropic" f="6796e194" showDate /> (Series G).

## Founder Donation Pledges

All seven co-founders have pledged to donate 80% of their equity. [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/01/27/anthropic-billionaire-cofounders-ceo-dario-amodei-giving-away-80-percent-of-wealth-fighting-inequality-ai-revolution/) At current valuations, that's <F e="anthropic" f="d5f91ab0">\$43–64B</F> if fully honored — derived from <F e="anthropic" f="c3e8a742">\$53–80B</F> in combined founder equity.

| Founder | EA Connection | Pledge Fulfillment Likelihood |
|---|---|---|
| **Dario Amodei** | **Strong** — GWWC signatory, early GiveWell supporter, former roommate of Holden Karnofsky | High |
| **Daniela Amodei** | **Strong** — married to Holden Karnofsky (GiveWell co-founder, now at Anthropic) | High |
| **Chris Olah** | **Moderate** — interpretability pioneer; has participated in EA events; work closely aligned with EA safety priorities | Medium |
| **Jack Clark** | **Moderate** — responsible AI advocate; founded Import AI newsletter; EA-adjacent framing in policy work | Medium |
| **Tom Brown** | Weak/unknown — GPT-3 lead author; chose Anthropic's safety mission; no documented EA pledge | Low-Medium |
| **Jared Kaplan** | Weak/unknown — scaling laws pioneer; safety-motivated co-founder; no documented EA pledge | Low-Medium |
| **Sam McCandlish** | Weak/unknown — alignment researcher; no publicly documented EA connections | Low-Medium |

Only **2 of 7 founders** have documented strong EA connections. The remaining 5 all chose to leave OpenAI specifically to found a safety-focused lab, suggesting at minimum EA-adjacent motivations — but no documented pledges or EA Forum activity for Brown, Kaplan, and McCandlish. Founder pledges are **not legally binding** — enforcement relies on reputational cost. Historical <EntityLink id="E531" name="giving-pledge">Giving Pledge</EntityLink> data shows only 36% of deceased pledgers met their commitment. [IPS](https://ips-dc.org/report-giving-pledge-at-15/)

## EA-Aligned Capital Summary

| Source | Gross Value | Risk-Adjusted Value | Reliability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strongly EA-aligned founders** (Dario, Daniela) | \$11-17B | \$6-12B | Pledge-dependent |
| **Safety-focused founders** (Olah, Clark) | \$11-17B | \$3-8B | Uncertain cause direction |
| **Non-EA founders** (Brown, Kaplan, McCandlish) | \$17-25B | \$2-7B | Unlikely EA |
| **Jaan Tallinn** | \$2-6B | \$1.4-5.4B | Very high (>90%) |
| **Dustin Moskovitz** | \$3-9B | \$2.7-9B | Certain (already committed) |
| **Employee pledges + matching** | \$20-40B | \$16-38B | Legally bound (in DAFs) |
| **Non-pledged EA employees** | ≈\$2B | \$0.4-0.8B | Moderate |
| **Total** | **\$66-116B** | <F e="anthropic" f="a8c71e05">**\$27-76B**</F> | — |

Employee capital in donor-advised funds (<F e="anthropic" f="a8c71e05">\$27–76B</F> risk-adjusted) is the **most reliable** source — legally bound, though donors retain discretion over which charities receive grants. The historical 3:1 matching program (employees pledge up to 50%, Anthropic matches 3x) has been **reduced to 1:1 at 25%** for employees hired after 2024.

## Capital Deployment Timeline

| Source | Earliest | Peak Flow | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee DAFs | 2025-2026 | 2027-2030 | Already transferring |
| Moskovitz | 2026-2027 | 2027-2030 | \$500M in nonprofit vehicle |
| Tallinn | 2027-2028 | 2028-2032 | Likely post-IPO |
| Founders | 2028-2030 | 2030-2040 | Depends on IPO + pledge timing |

IPO expected 2026-2027 (Kalshi: 72% chance Anthropic IPOs before OpenAI). Lock-up periods typically delay capital 6-12 months post-IPO. See <EntityLink id="E409" name="anthropic-ipo">Anthropic IPO</EntityLink>.

## Methodology & Assumptions

All figures in this table are estimates with significant uncertainty. Key assumptions:

**Equity stakes:**
- *Founders (2–3% each)*: Estimated from reported total founder equity (~14–21% for 7 co-founders). No individual founder stakes have been publicly disclosed; range reflects typical dilution across 7 people with differential contributions.
- *Google (~14%)*: Derived from Google's \$3.3B total investment and Anthropic's \$18B Series D valuation; cross-checked against [Bloomberg reporting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/google-commits-to-invest-2-billion-in-openai-rival-anthropic).
- *Tallinn (0.6–1.7%), Moskovitz (0.8–2.5%)*: Estimated from Series A lead position and subsequent dilution; no public disclosures.
- *Employee pool (12–18%)*: Typical early-stage AI lab employee equity range; diluted from founding allocations through Series G.

**Pledge rates:**
- *Founders (80%)*: Documented in [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/01/27/anthropic-billionaire-cofounders-ceo-dario-amodei-giving-away-80-percent-of-wealth-fighting-inequality-ai-revolution/) reporting on the public pledge announcement.
- *Employee pool (25–50%)*: Lower bound from current 1:1 matching at 25% for post-2024 hires; upper bound from historical 3:1 matching program at 50% for pre-2025 hires. See [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rRBaP7YbXfZibSn3C/front-load-giving-because-of-anthropic-donors).
- *Tallinn (90%), Moskovitz (95%)*: Based on documented giving track records and explicit commitments.

**EA alignment estimates (most uncertain column):**
- Based on: public statements, organizational affiliations, EA Forum activity, documented giving patterns, and whether donations have gone to EA-identified causes.
- Dario/Daniela: GWWC signatories with documented EA community ties → 80–90%.
- Chris Olah: Interpretability work is core EA-aligned; EA event participation → 40–60%.
- Jack Clark: EA-adjacent responsible AI framing, less documented EA cause alignment → 30–50%.
- Brown/Kaplan/McCandlish: Safety motivation for founding Anthropic but no documented EA cause preferences → 15–30%.
- Employee pool: Blended estimate across a population with high EA representation at senior levels → 40–70%.

These are Fermi estimates for planning purposes, not verified figures. The "EA-Effective" column represents *expected value* and should be treated with wide error bars.
