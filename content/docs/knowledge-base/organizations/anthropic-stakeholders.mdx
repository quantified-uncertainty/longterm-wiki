## Founder Donation Pledges

All seven co-founders have pledged to donate 80% of their equity. [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2026/01/27/anthropic-billionaire-cofounders-ceo-dario-amodei-giving-away-80-percent-of-wealth-fighting-inequality-ai-revolution/) At current valuations, that's **\$43-64B** if fully honored.

| Founder | EA Connection | Pledge Fulfillment Likelihood |
|---|---|---|
| **Dario Amodei** | **Strong** — GWWC signatory, early GiveWell supporter, former roommate of Holden Karnofsky | High |
| **Daniela Amodei** | **Strong** — married to Holden Karnofsky (GiveWell co-founder, now at Anthropic) | High |
| **Chris Olah** | Safety-focused — interpretability pioneer, no documented EA pledge | Medium |
| **Jack Clark** | Safety-focused — responsible AI advocate, no documented EA connections | Medium |
| **Tom Brown** | None documented | Low-Medium |
| **Jared Kaplan** | None documented | Low-Medium |
| **Sam McCandlish** | None documented | Low-Medium |

Only **2 of 7 founders** (Dario and Daniela, ~29% of founder equity) have documented strong EA connections. The remaining 5 founders (71% of equity) may direct donations to causes outside traditional EA priorities. Founder pledges are **not legally binding** — enforcement relies on reputational cost. Historical <EntityLink id="E531">Giving Pledge</EntityLink> data shows only 36% of deceased pledgers met their commitment. [IPS](https://ips-dc.org/report-giving-pledge-at-15/)

## EA-Aligned Capital Summary

| Source | Gross Value | Risk-Adjusted Value | Reliability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Strongly EA-aligned founders** (Dario, Daniela) | \$11-17B | \$6-12B | Pledge-dependent |
| **Safety-focused founders** (Olah, Clark) | \$11-17B | \$3-8B | Uncertain cause direction |
| **Non-EA founders** (Brown, Kaplan, McCandlish) | \$17-25B | \$2-7B | Unlikely EA |
| **Jaan Tallinn** | \$2-6B | \$1.4-5.4B | Very high (>90%) |
| **Dustin Moskovitz** | \$3-9B | \$2.7-9B | Certain (already committed) |
| **Employee pledges + matching** | \$20-40B | \$16-38B | Legally bound (in DAFs) |
| **Non-pledged EA employees** | ≈\$2B | \$0.4-0.8B | Moderate |
| **Total** | **\$66-116B** | **\$27-76B** | — |

Employee capital in donor-advised funds (\$16-38B risk-adjusted) is the **most reliable** source — legally bound, though donors retain discretion over which charities receive grants. The historical 3:1 matching program (employees pledge up to 50%, Anthropic matches 3x) has been **reduced to 1:1 at 25%** for employees hired after 2024.
