## Overview

The Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) is the largest AI policy research center in the United States, housed within Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service. Founded in January 2019 with a \$15 million grant from <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> (then <EntityLink id="E552">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink>), CSET has grown to become a dominant force in shaping U.S. technology policy, particularly regarding artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and competition with China.

CSET's mission centers on providing decision-makers with data-driven analysis on the security implications of emerging technologies. Unlike many think tanks that rely primarily on qualitative policy analysis, CSET has invested heavily in data infrastructure and quantitative research capabilities. The organization's Emerging Technology Observatory (ETO) hosts 10 public tools and 8 open datasets, providing unprecedented visibility into global AI research, patenting, and investment trends.

The organization's theory of impact operates through multiple channels: direct policy engagement through congressional testimony and government briefings, open-source data tools that inform policy decisions, translation of Chinese-language documents to increase transparency about China's AI ambitions, and rigorous research publications that shape the intellectual framework for AI policy debates. In 2024 alone, CSET researchers conducted hundreds of briefings with government officials and industry leaders, testified before Congress multiple times, and published over 80 pieces of analysis.

CSET's work spans several interconnected research areas: the foundations of AI development (talent, data, and computing power), AI applications in national security contexts, U.S.-China technology competition, export controls and semiconductor policy, and increasingly, the security dimensions of biotechnology. This breadth of coverage, combined with deep technical expertise and strong government relationships, has made CSET an essential resource for policymakers navigating complex technology decisions.

## History and Leadership

### Founding (2019)

CSET was established through a major philanthropic initiative by <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> (then Open Philanthropy), which recommended a \$15 million grant over five years to Georgetown University specifically to create a new think tank at the intersection of national security and emerging technologies. The founding was motivated by a perceived gap in rigorous, technically-informed policy analysis on AI security issues.

| Milestone | Date | Details |
|-----------|------|---------|
| <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> grant approved | January 2019 | \$15M over 5 years |
| CSET launched | January 2019 | Jason Matheny as founding director |
| CyberAI Project launched | January 2020 | Focus on AI/ML and cybersecurity |
| ETO launched | 2022 | Public data platform |
| Additional \$12M secured | 2023 | Total funding exceeds \$100M through 2025 |
| Hewlett Foundation grant | 2023 | \$1M for cyber and AI research |
| Helen Toner named Interim ED | September 2025 | Dewey Murdick departs |

### Founding Director: Jason Matheny

Jason Gaverick Matheny served as CSET's founding director from 2019 until he joined the Biden administration. His background uniquely positioned him to bridge intelligence community expertise with academic research:

| Role | Organization | Years |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Director | Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) | 2015-2018 |
| Assistant Director of National Intelligence | ODNI | Concurrent with IARPA |
| Research Affiliate | <EntityLink id="E140">Future of Humanity Institute</EntityLink>, Oxford | Prior to IARPA |
| Founder | New Harvest (cellular agriculture research) | 2004 |
| Deputy Assistant to the President | White House | 2021-2023 |
| Deputy Director for National Security | OSTP | 2021-2023 |

Matheny's transition to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, where he served as Deputy Director for National Security and Coordinator for Technology and National Security at the National Security Council, demonstrated CSET's success in placing personnel in key government positions.

### Current Leadership: Helen Toner

Helen Toner was named Interim Executive Director effective September 2, 2025, succeeding Dewey Murdick. Toner was named to TIME magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in AI in 2024 and has been central to CSET's strategy and research agenda since its founding.

## Strategic Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Data-Driven Methodology**: ETO and quantitative research provide unique policy insights not available from traditional think tanks
2. **China Expertise**: Translation program and Chinese-language data integration offer unparalleled visibility into Chinese AI development
3. **Funding Stability**: \$100M+ through 2025 enables long-term research investments
4. **Government Access**: Hundreds of annual briefings, regular congressional testimony, alumni in senior positions
5. **University Integration**: Georgetown affiliation provides academic credibility and talent pipeline

### Limitations

1. **U.S. Focus**: Less engagement with non-U.S. governments compared to organizations like GovAI
2. **Security Emphasis**: National security framing may limit engagement with AI safety community
3. **Funder Concentration**: Heavy reliance on <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink>, though diversifying
4. **Political Transitions**: Changes in administration affect policy relevance and access

### Key Uncertainties

| Question | Significance |
|----------|--------------|
| Post-2025 funding sustainability | Will diversification efforts succeed? |
| Leadership transition | How will Toner's interim appointment evolve? |
| Political environment | How will CSET navigate changing administrations? |
| ETO development | Will data tools become self-sustaining? |
| China policy evolution | Will U.S.-China focus remain central or broaden? |
