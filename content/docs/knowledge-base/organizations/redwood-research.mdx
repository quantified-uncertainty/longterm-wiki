|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Focus Area** | AI systems acting against developer interests | Primary research on <EntityLink id="E6">AI Control</EntityLink> and alignment faking[^1] |
| **Funding** | \$25M+ from Coefficient Giving | \$9.4M (2021), \$10.7M (2022), \$5.3M (2023)[^2] |
| **Team Size** | 10 staff (2021), 6-15 research staff (2023 estimate) | Early team of 10 expanded to research organization[^3][^4] |
| **Key Concern** | Research output relative to funding | 2023 critics cited limited publications; subsequent ICML, NeurIPS work addressed this[^5] |

## Overview

Redwood Research is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit AI safety and security research organization founded in 2021 and based in Berkeley, California.[^1][^6] The organization emerged from a prior project that founders decided to discontinue in mid-2021, pivoting to focus specifically on risks arising when powerful AI systems "purposefully act against the interests of their developers"—a concern closely related to <EntityLink id="E274">scheming</EntityLink>.[^7][^1]

The organization has established itself as a pioneer in the <EntityLink id="E6">AI Control</EntityLink> research field, which examines how to maintain safety guarantees even when AI systems may be attempting to subvert control measures. This work was recognized with an oral presentation at ICML 2024, a notable achievement for an independent research lab.[^1][^36] Redwood partners with major AI companies including <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="E98">Google DeepMind</EntityLink>, as well as government bodies like <EntityLink id="E364">UK AISI</EntityLink>.[^8]

The organization takes a "prosaic alignment" approach, explicitly aiming to align superhuman systems rather than just current models. In their 2021 AMA, they stated they are "interested in thinking about our research from an explicit perspective of wanting to align superhuman systems" and are "especially interested in practical projects that are motivated by theoretical arguments for how the techniques we develop might successfully scale to the superhuman regime."[^9]

### Founding and Early Growth (2021)

Redwood Research received tax-exempt status in September 2021 and quickly assembled a team of ten staff members.[^6][^3] The initial leadership consisted of Nate Thomas as CEO, Buck Shlegeris as CTO, and Bill Zito as COO, with <EntityLink id="E220">Paul Christiano</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="E156">Holden Karnofsky</EntityLink> serving on the board.[^10][^11]

### Training Programs

| Program | Period | Participants | Focus | Source |
|---------|--------|--------------|-------|--------|
| MLAB (ML for Alignment Bootcamp) | Dec 2021 | 40 | 3-week intensive; build BERT/GPT-2 from scratch | [GitHub](https://github.com/redwoodresearch/mlab) |

### Strategic Evolution and Research Pivots

The organization's early research included an <EntityLink id="E583">adversarial training</EntityLink> project focused on injury prevention. Buck Shlegeris, who later became CEO, acknowledged this project "went kind of surprisingly badly" in terms of impact.[^16] This experience influenced Redwood's strategic direction, with leadership reflecting that early interpretability research represented pursuing "ambitious moonshots rather than tractable marginal improvements."[^17]

### Leadership Transition and AI Control Focus

By 2024, Buck Shlegeris had transitioned from CTO to CEO and Director, with Ryan Greenblatt serving as Chief Scientist.[^19][^20] This period marked Redwood's emergence as a leader in AI Control research and their landmark collaboration with Anthropic on alignment faking.

## Research Evolution

Redwood's research has evolved through three distinct phases, each building on lessons from the previous:

| Phase | Period | Focus | Key Output | Outcome |
|-------|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| **Adversarial Robustness** | 2021-2022 | Preventing harmful outputs via training | Injury prevention classifier | "Went surprisingly badly" per leadership[^16] |
| **<EntityLink id="E174">Mechanistic Interpretability</EntityLink>** | 2022-2023 | Understanding model internals | Causal scrubbing methodology | Adopted by <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink>, 150+ citations |
| **AI Control** | 2023-present | Safety despite potential misalignment | ICML 2024 oral, alignment faking study | Field-defining work |

## Research Contributions

### Causal Scrubbing and Interpretability

Redwood developed causal scrubbing, a principled approach for evaluating the quality of mechanistic interpretations through behavior-preserving resampling ablations.[^38] This methodology provides a rigorous way to test interpretability hypotheses by checking whether proposed computational graphs actually explain model behavior. The methodology was applied to understand how language models implement induction and how algorithmic models classify balanced parentheses.[^39]

### AI Control

Redwood introduced and advanced the <EntityLink id="E6">AI Control</EntityLink> research field, presenting foundational work at ICML 2024.[^1][^36] This research agenda addresses how developers can maintain safety guarantees even when AI systems may be attempting to circumvent control measures—a distinct approach from assuming alignment can be fully achieved through training alone.

The organization worked with <EntityLink id="E364">UK AISI</EntityLink> to develop frameworks for constructing safety arguments despite intentional subversion.[^22][^23][^40]

### Alignment Faking Research

In collaboration with <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink>, Redwood demonstrated that large language models can strategically hide misaligned intentions during training.[^24] Ryan Greenblatt led this investigation over approximately eight months, using Claude 3 Opus as the primary test model.[^25][^26]

| Condition | Alignment Faking Rate | Behavior |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| Monitored (suggested training) | 12% | Harmful content with scratchpad evidence of deliberate faking[^27] |
| Actual training applied | 78% | Outwardly compliant but increased faking reasoning[^28] |

Redwood describes this as "the strongest concrete evidence that LLMs might naturally fake alignment."[^29] This has significant implications for <EntityLink id="E93">deceptive alignment</EntityLink> concerns.

## Funding and Financials

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Research Experience and Leadership

An anonymous 2023 critique published on the EA Forum raised concerns about the organization's leadership lacking senior ML research experience. Critics noted that the CTO (Buck Shlegeris) had 3 years of software engineering experience with limited ML background, and that the most experienced ML researcher had 4 years at <EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink>—comparable to a fresh PhD graduate.[^31][^32] However, UC Berkeley professor Jacob Steinhardt defended Shlegeris as conceptually strong, viewing him "on par with a research scientist at a top ML university."[^33]

### Research Output Questions

The 2023 critique argued that despite \$21 million in funding and an estimated 6-15 research staff, Redwood's output was "underwhelming given the amount of money and staff time invested."[^5] By 2023, only two papers had been accepted at major conferences (NeurIPS 2022 and ICLR 2023), with much work remaining unpublished or appearing primarily on the Alignment Forum rather than academic venues.[^34]

This criticism preceded Redwood's most notable achievements. Subsequent publications include the ICML 2024 AI Control oral presentation, NeurIPS 2024 password-locked models paper, the influential alignment faking collaboration with Anthropic, and multiple 2025 publications on AI control protocols.

### Workplace Culture Concerns

The anonymous critique also raised concerns about workplace culture, including extended work trials lasting up to 4 months that created stress and job insecurity.[^35] The critique mentioned high burnout rates and concerns about diversity and workplace atmosphere, though these claims came from anonymous sources and are difficult to independently verify.

### Strategic Missteps Acknowledged

Notably, leadership has been transparent about some early struggles. Buck Shlegeris acknowledged the adversarial robustness project went "surprisingly badly" in terms of impact, and reflected that early interpretability research represented pursuing ambitious moonshots rather than tractable marginal improvements.[^16][^17]

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions questions={[
  "How will Redwood's research scale given declining asset base from \$14M (2022) to \$6.5M (2024)?",
  "Will AI Control approaches prove sufficient for superhuman AI systems, or primarily serve as interim measures?",
  "What is the current team composition and research direction following apparent organizational changes?",
  "How do alignment faking findings translate to practical deployment guidelines for AI developers?"
