## Overview

The <R id="a306e0b63bdedbd5">Center for AI Safety (CAIS)</R> is a nonprofit research organization that works to reduce societal-scale risks from artificial intelligence through technical research, field-building initiatives, and public communication efforts. Founded by <EntityLink id="dan-hendrycks">Dan Hendrycks</EntityLink>, CAIS gained widespread recognition for organizing the landmark "Statement on AI Risk" in May 2023, which received signatures from over 350 AI researchers and industry leaders.

CAIS's multi-pronged approach combines cutting-edge technical research on AI alignment and robustness with strategic field-building efforts that have supported over 200 researchers through grants and fellowships. The organization's work spans from fundamental research on <R id="22d74e88304202f8"><EntityLink id="representation-engineering">representation engineering</EntityLink></R> to developing critical safety benchmarks like the <R id="6d4e8851e33e1641">MACHIAVELLI dataset</R> for evaluating deceptive AI behavior.
