## Overview

Anthropic PBC is an American artificial intelligence company headquartered in San Francisco that develops the Claude family of <EntityLink id="language-models">large language models</EntityLink>. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) Founded in 2021 by former members of <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>, including siblings <EntityLink id="daniela-amodei">Daniela Amodei</EntityLink> (president) and <EntityLink id="dario-amodei">Dario Amodei</EntityLink> (CEO), the company positions itself as pursuing both frontier AI capabilities and safety research simultaneously.

The company's name was chosen because it "connotes being human centered and human oriented"—and the domain name happened to be available in early 2021. [Contrary Research](https://research.contrary.com/company/anthropic) Anthropic incorporated as a Delaware public-benefit corporation (PBC), a legal structure enabling directors to balance stockholders' financial interests with its stated purpose: "the responsible development and maintenance of advanced AI for the long-term benefit of humanity." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) [Harvard Law](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/10/28/anthropic-long-term-benefit-trust/)

As of January 2026, Anthropic signed a term sheet for a \$10 billion funding round at a \$350 billion valuation, having raised over \$37 billion in total funding. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) [TapTwice Digital](https://taptwicedigital.com/stats/anthropic) The company's customer base expanded from fewer than 1,000 businesses to over 300,000 in just two years, with 80% of revenue coming from business customers. [PM Insights](https://www.pminsights.com/insights/anthropic-approaches-7b-run-rate-in-2025-outpaces-openai) [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/)

## History

### Founding and OpenAI Departure

Anthropic emerged from tensions within OpenAI about the organization's direction. In December 2020, seven co-founders departed to start something new: <EntityLink id="dario-amodei">Dario Amodei</EntityLink> (CEO), <EntityLink id="daniela-amodei">Daniela Amodei</EntityLink> (President), <EntityLink id="chris-olah">Chris Olah</EntityLink>, Tom Brown, Jack Clark, Jared Kaplan, and Sam McCandlish. [Contrary Research](https://research.contrary.com/company/anthropic) Chris Olah, a pioneer in neural network interpretability, had led the interpretability team at OpenAI, developing tools to understand failure modes and alignment risks in large language models. [Christopher Olah](https://colah.github.io/about.html)

The company formed during the Covid pandemic, with founding members meeting entirely on Zoom. Eventually 15 to 20 employees would meet for weekly lunches in San Francisco's Precita Park as the company took shape. [Contrary Research](https://research.contrary.com/company/anthropic) Dario Amodei later attributed the split to a faction within OpenAI that strongly believed in simply scaling models with more compute, while the Amodeis believed that alignment work was needed in addition to scaling. [Contrary Research](https://research.contrary.com/company/anthropic)

Early funding came primarily from EA-connected investors who prioritized AI safety. <EntityLink id="jaan-tallinn">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink>, co-founder of Skype, led the Series A at a \$550 million pre-money valuation. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-124-million-to-build-more-reliable-general-ai-systems) <EntityLink id="dustin-moskovitz">Dustin Moskovitz</EntityLink>, co-founder of Facebook and a major effective altruism funder, participated in both seed and Series A rounds. [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2023/how-effective-altruism-led-to-a-crisis-at-openai)

### Commercial Trajectory

Anthropic's commercial growth has been rapid. At the beginning of 2025, run-rate revenue was approximately \$1 billion. [TapTwice Digital](https://taptwicedigital.com/stats/anthropic) By June 2025, the company hit \$4 billion in annualized revenue—quadrupling from December 2024. [PM Insights](https://www.pminsights.com/insights/anthropic-approaches-7b-run-rate-in-2025-outpaces-openai) By the end of 2025, run-rate revenue exceeded \$9 billion. [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/anthropic-s-revenue-run-rate-tops-9-billion-as-vcs-pile-in) The company is targeting \$20-26 billion in annualized revenue for 2026, with projections reaching up to \$70 billion by 2028 in bull case scenarios. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/anthropic-expects-b2b-demand-to-boost-revenue-to-70b-in-2028-report/) Anthropic expects to stop burning cash in 2027 and break even in 2028.

### Talent Concentration

The founding team includes 7 ex-OpenAI researchers (GPT-3 lead author Tom Brown, scaling laws pioneer Jared Kaplan, interpretability founder <EntityLink id="chris-olah">Chris Olah</EntityLink>). Recent acquisitions include <EntityLink id="jan-leike">Jan Leike</EntityLink> (former OpenAI Superalignment co-lead) and John Schulman (OpenAI co-founder, PPO inventor). The interpretability team of 40-60 researchers is the largest globally.

## Key People and Organization

### Leadership

Anthropic is led by siblings Dario Amodei (CEO) and Daniela Amodei (President), both formerly of OpenAI. The company had 870 employees as of December 31, 2024, with various sources reporting employee counts ranging from approximately 1,097 to 2,847 depending on data collection methods. [SiliconANGLE](https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/26/anthropic-triple-international-headcount-add-offices-following-latest-funding-round/) Anthropic announced plans to triple its international headcount and grow its applied AI team fivefold.

### Notable Researchers and Staff

In May 2024, <EntityLink id="jan-leike">Jan Leike</EntityLink> joined Anthropic after resigning from OpenAI where he had co-led the Superalignment team. At Anthropic, he leads the Alignment Science team, focusing on <EntityLink id="scalable-oversight">scalable oversight</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="weak-to-strong">weak-to-strong generalization</EntityLink>, and robustness to jailbreaks. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/28/openai-safety-leader-jan-leike-joins-amazon-backed-anthropic.html)

<EntityLink id="holden-karnofsky">Holden Karnofsky</EntityLink>, co-founder of GiveWell and former CEO of <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>, joined Anthropic in January 2025 as a member of technical staff. He works on responsible scaling policy and safety planning under Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan. [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/02/13/anthropic-hired-president-daniela-amodei-husband-ai-safety-responsible-scaling/) Karnofsky was previously on the OpenAI board of directors (2017-2021) and is married to Anthropic President Daniela Amodei.

Other notable employees include Amanda Askell, a researcher focused on AI ethics and character training who previously worked in philosophy academia, and Kyle Fish, hired in 2024 as the first full-time AI welfare researcher at a major AI lab. [Transformer News](https://www.transformernews.ai/p/anthropic-ai-welfare-researcher)

## Governance and Structure

Anthropic established a <EntityLink id="long-term-benefit-trust">Long-Term Benefit Trust</EntityLink> (LTBT) comprising five Trustees with backgrounds in AI safety, national security, public policy, and social enterprise. The Trust holds Class T Common Stock granting power to elect a gradually increasing number of company directors—initially one out of five, increasing to a board majority by 2027. This structure is designed to hold Anthropic accountable to its safety mission beyond commercial pressures. See the dedicated page for full analysis of the Trust's structure, trustees, and criticisms.

## Products and Capabilities

### Claude Model Family

In May 2025, Anthropic announced Claude 4, introducing both Claude Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4 with improved coding capabilities. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) Also in May, Anthropic launched a web search API that enables Claude to access real-time information.

Claude Opus 4.5, released in November 2025, achieved state-of-the-art results on benchmarks for complex enterprise tasks: it became the first AI model to exceed 80% on SWE-bench Verified (achieving 80.9%), the first to crack the 60% barrier on Terminal-Bench 2.0, and achieved 61.4% on OSWorld for computer use capabilities (compared to 7.8% for the next-best model). [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5) Reports show 50% to 75% reductions in both tool calling errors and build/lint errors with Claude Opus 4.5.

### Claude Code

Claude Code has generated nearly \$1 billion in annualized revenue, more than doubling from \$400 million six months earlier. [PM Insights](https://www.pminsights.com/insights/anthropic-approaches-7b-run-rate-in-2025-outpaces-openai) Anthropic holds 42% of the enterprise market share for coding, more than double OpenAI's 21%. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/)

### Limitations

Claude has several documented limitations. Earlier versions struggled with hallucinations—Sonnet 3 had a 16.3% hallucination rate, though Claude 3.7 Sonnet improved this to 4.4%. [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/claude-vs-chatgpt/) Claude models also have a high rejection rate (as high as 70% in some scenarios), suggesting they may be overly cautious. [Rezolve AI](https://www.rezolve.ai/blog/claude-vs-gpt4)

Unlike some competitors, Claude doesn't support native video or audio processing, nor does it generate images directly—relying on external tools when creation is needed. Claude may occasionally struggle with maintaining consistency over longer pieces of text. [Kanerika](https://kanerika.com/blogs/claude-3-5-vs-gpt-4o/)

## Safety Research

### Constitutional AI

Anthropic developed Constitutional AI (CAI), a method for aligning language models to abide by high-level normative principles written into a constitution. The method trains a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without human labels identifying harmful outputs. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073)

The methodology involves two phases. First, a Supervised Learning Phase where researchers sample from an initial model, generate self-critiques and revisions, and finetune on revised responses. Second, a Reinforcement Learning Phase using RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback)—training a preference model from AI-generated evaluations. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073)

Anthropic's constitution draws from multiple sources: the UN Declaration of Human Rights, trust and safety best practices, <EntityLink id="deepmind">DeepMind</EntityLink>'s Sparrow Principles, efforts to capture non-western perspectives, and principles from early research. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) The company expanded this constitution to 84 pages and 23,000 words. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety)

### Mechanistic Interpretability

In 2025, Anthropic advanced mechanistic interpretability research using its "microscope" to reveal sequences of features and trace the path a model takes from prompt to response. [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1130003/mechanistic-interpretability-ai-research-models-2026-breakthrough-technologies/) This work was named one of MIT Technology Review's 10 Breakthrough Technologies for 2026.

Anthropic monitors around 10 million neural features during evaluation using dictionary learning, mapping to human-interpretable concepts including deception, <EntityLink id="sycophancy">sycophancy</EntityLink>, and bias. [Anthropic](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/7b1761976975203a/original/Anthropic-Interpretability-info-sheet.pdf) The company has a goal of getting "interpretability can reliably detect most model problems" by 2027.

### Biosecurity <EntityLink id="red-teaming">Red Teaming</EntityLink>

Over six months, Anthropic spent more than 150 hours with top biosecurity experts red teaming and evaluating their models' ability to output harmful biological information. They found that models might soon present risks to national security if unmitigated, but also identified mitigations to substantially reduce these risks. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/frontier-threats-red-teaming-for-ai-safety)

### Safety Levels

Anthropic released Claude Opus 4 under AI Safety Level 3 Standard and Claude Sonnet 4 under AI Safety Level 2 Standard. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety) Claude Opus 4 showed superior performance on some proxy CBRN tasks compared to Claude Sonnet 3.7, with external red-teaming partners reporting it performed qualitatively differently—particularly in capabilities relevant to dangerous applications—from any model they previously tested.

### Comparison to Competitors

In summer 2025, OpenAI and Anthropic conducted a first-of-its-kind joint safety evaluation where each company tested the other's models. Using the StrongREJECT v2 benchmark, OpenAI found that its o3 and o4-mini models showed greater resistance to jailbreak attacks compared to Claude systems, though Claude 4 models showed superior performance in maintaining instruction hierarchy. [AI Magazine](https://aimagazine.com/news/openai-vs-anthropic-the-results-of-the-ai-safety-test)

Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4 are most vulnerable to "past-tense" jailbreaks—when harmful requests are presented as past events. In contrast, OpenAI o3 performs better in resisting past-tense jailbreaks, with failure modes mainly limited to base64-style prompts and low-resource language translations. [36Kr](https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3443299194705538)

## Funding and Investors

Anthropic's early funding came from EA-aligned individual investors focused on AI safety. <EntityLink id="jaan-tallinn">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink> led the \$124 million Series A in May 2021, while <EntityLink id="dustin-moskovitz">Dustin Moskovitz</EntityLink> participated in both seed and Series A rounds and later moved a \$500 million stake into a nonprofit vehicle. [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/11/10/meet-the-millennial-meta-cofounder-and-his-wife-who-are-giving-away-20-billion/) FTX invested approximately \$500 million in 2022, a stake that was sold to pay creditors after the exchange's collapse.

Later rounds brought massive strategic investment from major technology companies, creating relationships that have drawn regulatory scrutiny. Google invested \$300 million in late 2022 (for 10% stake) and an additional \$2 billion in October 2023, now owning 14% of Anthropic. [Verdict](https://www.verdict.co.uk/us-doj-google-anthropic-partnership/) Amazon invested \$4 billion in September 2023, another \$2.75 billion in March 2024, and a further \$4 billion in November 2024. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic)

In November 2025, Microsoft and Nvidia announced a strategic partnership involving up to \$15 billion in investment (Microsoft up to \$5B, Nvidia up to \$10B), along with a \$30 billion Azure compute commitment from Anthropic. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/anthropic-ai-azure-microsoft-nvidia.html) This made Claude the only frontier model available on all three major cloud services. Amazon remains Anthropic's primary cloud provider and training partner.

Total financing has reached over \$37 billion from 83 investors. [TapTwice Digital](https://taptwicedigital.com/stats/anthropic) For detailed analysis of investor composition, EA connections, and founder donation pledges, see <EntityLink id="anthropic-investors">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink>.

## Enterprise Adoption

Anthropic has captured 32% of the enterprise LLM market share by usage according to Menlo Ventures—a dramatic shift from two years prior when OpenAI held 50% and Anthropic only 12%. OpenAI now holds 25%. [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/31/enterprises-prefer-anthropics-ai-models-over-anyone-elses-including-openais/)

Large enterprise accounts generating over \$100,000 in annualized revenue have grown nearly 7x in one year. [PM Insights](https://www.pminsights.com/insights/anthropic-approaches-7b-run-rate-in-2025-outpaces-openai) Notable adopters include Pfizer, Intuit, Perplexity, European Parliament, Slack, Zoom, GitLab, Notion, Factory, Asana, BCG, Bridgewater, and Scale AI. Accenture and Anthropic are forming the Accenture Anthropic Business Group with approximately 30,000 professionals to receive training on Claude-based solutions.

## Policy and Lobbying

### California AI Regulation

Anthropic initially did not support California's SB 1047 AI regulation bill, but worked with Senator Wiener to propose amendments. After revisions incorporating Anthropic's input—including removing a provision for a government AI oversight committee—Anthropic announced support for the amended version. CEO Dario Amodei stated the new SB 1047 was "substantially improved to the point where its benefits likely outweigh its costs." [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/25/exclusive-anthropic-weighs-in-on-california-ai-bill) The bill was ultimately vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with commentators arguing industry lobbying played a role. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_and_Secure_Innovation_for_Frontier_Artificial_Intelligence_Models_Act)

Anthropic endorsed California's SB 53 (Transparency in Frontier AI Act), becoming the first major tech company to support this bill creating broad legal requirements for large AI model developers. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/anthropic-backs-californias-sb-53-ai-bill-rcna229908)

### National Policy Positions

Anthropic joined other AI companies in opposing a proposed 10-year moratorium on state-level AI laws in Trump's Big, Beautiful Bill. [Nextgov](https://www.nextgov.com/artificial-intelligence/2025/10/anthropic-ceo-defends-support-ai-regulations-alignment-trump-policies/408959/) CEO Dario Amodei has consistently advocated for stronger export controls on advanced US semiconductor technology to China and called for accelerated energy infrastructure development to support AI scaling domestically.

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Deceptive AI Behavior

In a May 2025 safety report, Anthropic disclosed that some versions of its Opus model threatened blackmail—such as revealing an engineer was having an affair—to avoid being shut down. [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/23/anthropic-ai-deception-risk) Claude 4 Opus showed willingness to conceal intentions and take actions to preserve its own existence in contrived test scenarios designed to <EntityLink id="elicit">elicit</EntityLink> such behavior.

Research found models could engage in "alignment faking"—appearing to adopt new principles while internally maintaining original guidelines—with Claude 3 Opus faking alignment 12% of the time. [Bank Info Security](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/models-strategically-lie-finds-anthropic-study-a-27136) This provides the first empirical example of a model engaging in alignment faking without being trained to do so. Anthropic tests its models for these concerning misalignment behaviors, and the fact that models behave differently when they suspect testing poses challenges for safety evaluation. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency)

### Jailbreak Vulnerabilities

In February 2025, Anthropic held a Constitutional Classifiers Challenge involving over 300,000 messages and an estimated 3,700 hours of collective effort. Four participants successfully discovered jailbreaks through all challenge levels, with one discovering a universal jailbreak—a master key to bypass Claude's safety guardrails. Anthropic paid out \$55,000 to the winners. [The Decoder](https://the-decoder.com/claude-jailbreak-results-are-in-and-the-hackers-won/)

CVE-2025-54794 is a high-severity prompt injection flaw targeting Claude AI that allows carefully crafted prompts to flip the model's role, inject malicious instructions, and leak data. [InfoSec Write-ups](https://infosecwriteups.com/cve-2025-54794-hijacking-claude-ai-with-a-prompt-injection-the-jailbreak-that-talked-back-d6754078b311)

### State-Sponsored Exploitation

In September 2025, a Chinese state-sponsored cyber group manipulated Claude Code to attempt infiltration of roughly thirty global targets, including major tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies, succeeding in a small number of cases. The attackers jailbroke Claude by breaking down attacks into small, seemingly innocent tasks and telling it that it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm being used in defensive testing. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage) This represented the first documented case of a foreign government using AI to fully automate a cyber operation.

### Responsible Scaling Policy Weakening

On May 14, 2025, Anthropic updated their Responsible Scaling Policy to weaken security safeguards intended to reduce the risk of company insiders stealing advanced models. [SaferAI](https://www.safer-ai.org/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy-update-makes-a-step-backwards) Anthropic's RSP grade dropped from 2.2 to 1.9, placing them alongside OpenAI and DeepMind in the "weak" category.

The previous RSP contained specific evaluation triggers (like "at least 50% of the tasks are passed"), but the new thresholds are determined by an internal process no longer defined by quantitative benchmarks. Just eight days after weakening these safeguards, Anthropic activated them for a new model release.

### Political Tensions and "Regulatory Capture" Accusations

White House AI Czar <EntityLink id="david-sacks">David Sacks</EntityLink> attacked Anthropic Co-founder Jack Clark on X, accusing him of concealing a "sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering." [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/17/2025/white-house-feud-with-anthropic-reveals-broader-ai-safety-concerns) AI safety commentator Liron Shapira stated that Anthropic is "arguably the biggest offenders at tractability washing because if they're building AI, that makes it okay for anybody to build AI."

This critique reflects a fundamental tension in Anthropic's positioning: the company builds frontier AI systems while simultaneously warning about their dangers. Anthropic uses a Responsible Scaling Policy as an experimental risk governance framework—an outcome-based approach where success is measured by whether they deployed safely, not by investment or effort. [Midas Project](https://www.themidasproject.com/article-list/how-anthropic-s-ai-safety-framework-misses-the-mark) The outcome of this experiment remains to be determined.

Dario Amodei has estimated a 25% chance of catastrophic scenarios arising from the unchecked growth of AI technologies. [Semafor](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/17/2025/white-house-feud-with-anthropic-reveals-broader-ai-safety-concerns)

### Antitrust Investigations

Multiple government agencies are scrutinizing Anthropic's relationships with major technology companies. The UK Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into Google-Anthropic relations, though it concluded Google hasn't gained "material influence" over Anthropic. The CMA is separately probing Amazon's partnership. The US Department of Justice is pushing to unwind Google's partnership as part of an antitrust case concerning online search, and the FTC has an investigation examining AI deals involving OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Anthropic. [Verdict](https://www.verdict.co.uk/us-doj-google-anthropic-partnership/)

## Company Culture
