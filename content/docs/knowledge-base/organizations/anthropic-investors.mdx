title: Anthropic as EA Funding Source
description: "Analysis of EA-aligned philanthropic capital from Anthropic equity holders. At $380B valuation (Series G, Feb 2026): $27-76B risk-adjusted EA capital from founder pledges (80% of equity from 7 co-founders, though only 2/7 have documented EA connections), investor stakes (Tallinn $2-6B, Moskovitz $3-9B), and employee matching programs ($20-40B in DAFs). Matching program reduced from 3:1@50% to 1:1@25% for new hires. Legal status of founder pledges unclear."

llmSummary: "Model of EA-aligned philanthropic capital from Anthropic equity holders. At $380B valuation (Series G, Feb 2026, $30B raised): $27-76B risk-adjusted EA capital expected from multiple sources. Total funding raised exceeds $67B. Sources include: 7 co-founders pledged 80% of equity (only 2/7—Dario and Daniela Amodei—have documented strong EA connections; 5/7 have uncertain EA alignment). Early EA investors Jaan Tallinn ($2-6B conservative estimate, down from $5-14B optimistic due to possible secondary sales) and Dustin Moskovitz ($3-9B, portion already in nonprofit vehicle) hold substantial stakes. Employee matching program historically 3:1 at 50% of equity, now 1:1 at 25% for new hires—$20-40B estimated already in DAFs, though cause allocation remains donor-controlled. Extended scenarios: at $500-700B (moderate bull), EA capital reaches $50-140B; at $1T+ (strong bull), $70-200B+. Critical uncertainty: cause allocation of 5/7 founders with undocumented or non-EA priorities. Timeline: employee capital 2027-2030 (IPO liquidity); founder capital 2030-2040 (gradual liquidation). Pledge fulfillment risk varies by source."

## Overview

<EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink>'s valuation growth—from \$550 million in May 2021 to \$380 billion by February 2026 (Series G)—has created substantial philanthropic capital among equity holders with varying degrees of EA alignment.[^anthropic-series-g] EA-aligned equity spans multiple sources: all seven co-founders have pledged to donate 80% of their equity (though only 2 of 7 have documented strong EA connections),[^fortune-pledge] early investors <EntityLink id="E577">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink> (conservative estimate: \$2-6B) and <EntityLink id="E436">Dustin Moskovitz</EntityLink> (\$3-9B) hold substantial stakes,[^fortune-moskovitz] and early employees transferred billions to donor-advised funds under Anthropic's historical 3:1 matching program (now 1:1 at 25% for new hires).[^anthropic-careers]

[^fortune-moskovitz]: Fortune. (2025, November 10). "Meet the millennial Meta cofounder and his wife who are giving away \$20 billion." https://fortune.com/2025/11/10/meet-the-millennial-meta-cofounder-and-his-wife-who-are-giving-away-20-billion/

[^anthropic-careers]: Anthropic Careers. https://www.anthropic.com/careers

Total EA-aligned capital at current valuations ranges from **\$33-172B gross** (conservative to optimistic assumptions), with a risk-adjusted expected value of **\$27-76B**—the wide range reflecting genuine uncertainty about founder cause allocation. An estimated \$20-40B is already legally bound in DAFs through the employee matching program, though DAF donors retain discretion over which charities receive grants, and the matching program has been reduced from 3:1 at 50% to 1:1 at 25% for new employees.[^anthropic-careers]

This page provides analysis of EA-aligned capital sources from Anthropic equity holders, models funding flows under different scenarios, and assesses when this capital may reach effective causes.

### Early Rounds: EA-Dominated (2021-2022)

Anthropic's founding capital came primarily from EA-connected investors focused on AI safety:

**<EntityLink id="E577">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink>** led the Series A at a \$550 million pre-money valuation.[^anthropic-series-a] Tallinn, co-founder of Skype and Kazaa, has funded multiple EA-aligned organizations including the <EntityLink id="E523">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk</EntityLink> (CSER) and the <EntityLink id="E528">Future of Life Institute</EntityLink> (FLI), and has invested in AI startups while funding AI safety nonprofits.[^semafor-ea-openai]

[^anthropic-series-a]: Anthropic. (2021, May). "Anthropic raises \$124 million to build more reliable general AI systems." https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-124-million-to-build-more-reliable-general-ai-systems

[^semafor-ea-openai]: Semafor. (2023, November 21). "How effective altruism led to a crisis at OpenAI." https://www.semafor.com/article/11/21/2023/how-effective-altruism-led-to-a-crisis-at-openai

**Dustin Moskovitz**, co-founder of Facebook and funder of <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> (formerly <EntityLink id="E552">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>), participated in both seed and Series A rounds. Through Good Ventures, Moskovitz later moved a \$500 million Anthropic stake into a nonprofit vehicle to reinvest returns.[^fortune-moskovitz]

**Other early investors** included Eric Schmidt (former Google CEO), James McClave, and the Center for Emerging Risk Research.

### Strategic Tech Investments (2023-2025)

Later rounds brought large strategic investments from technology companies:

**Google**: Invested approximately \$3.3 billion total across three rounds (late 2022, October 2023, early 2025), now owning approximately 14% of Anthropic.[^verdict-google-anthropic]

[^verdict-google-anthropic]: Verdict. "US DOJ Google Anthropic partnership." https://www.verdict.co.uk/us-doj-google-anthropic-partnership/

**Amazon**: Invested \$10.75 billion total across three rounds (September 2023, March 2024, November 2024). AWS became Anthropic's primary cloud and training partner. Amazon remains a minority investor without board seat.

### Institutional Investors (Series F)

The September 2025 Series F brought diversified institutional capital including sovereign wealth funds (Qatar Investment Authority, GIC Singapore), pension funds (Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan), and asset managers (BlackRock, T. Rowe Price, Goldman Sachs Alternatives).[^anthropic-series-f]

### Microsoft and Nvidia Partnership (November 2025)

In November 2025, Microsoft and Nvidia announced a strategic partnership with Anthropic involving up to \$15 billion in investment (Microsoft up to \$5B, Nvidia up to \$10B).[^cnbc-microsoft-nvidia] Anthropic committed to purchasing \$30 billion in Azure compute capacity from Microsoft and contracted for up to 1 gigawatt of compute capacity. The partnership includes joint optimization of Anthropic models for Nvidia architectures.[^anthropic-microsoft-nvidia]

### Secondary Market Activity

Anthropic shares trade on secondary markets with price variation across platforms. As of December 2025:[^premier-alts-anthropic]

[^premier-alts-anthropic]: Premier Alternatives. "Anthropic Secondary Market Price." https://www.premieralts.com/companies/anthropic/secondary-market-price

## Founder Equity and Donation Pledges

### Founder Pledge Overview

All seven Anthropic co-founders—<EntityLink id="E91">Dario Amodei</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="E90">Daniela Amodei</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="E59">Chris Olah</EntityLink>, Tom Brown, Jack Clark, Jared Kaplan, and Sam McCandlish—have pledged to donate 80% of their equity.[^fortune-pledge] The pledge was announced alongside Dario Amodei's January 2026 essay "The Adolescence of Technology," which frames AI-driven wealth inequality as a central concern.[^ea-forum-dario-essay]

[^ea-forum-dario-essay]: EA Forum. "Dario Amodei on AI Risk and Anthropic's Approach." https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TPJju3zv7b2fdwgmE/dario-amodei-on-ai-risk-and-anthropic-s-approach-the

Amodei wrote: "The thing to worry about is a level of wealth concentration that will break society." He cited <EntityLink id="E116">Elon Musk</EntityLink>'s nearly \$700 billion net worth exceeding John D. Rockefeller's Gilded Age wealth as evidence of concentration before most of AI's economic impact has materialized. The essay calls for progressive taxation and government intervention as longer-term solutions, framing private philanthropy as a way to "buy time."[^inc-ai-ceo-inequality]

[^inc-ai-ceo-inequality]: Inc. "AI CEO says inequality will skyrocket and wants the most powerful to pay more." https://www.inc.com/ben-sherry/ai-ceo-says-inequality-will-skyrocket-and-wants-the-most-powerful-to-pay-more/91293031

**Legal status:** The pledges are public commitments. Whether they have legal binding force (e.g., as enforceable contracts or charitable pledge agreements) is not publicly documented. Unlike the <EntityLink id="E421">OpenAI Foundation</EntityLink>'s legal control over board appointments, enforcement appears to rely on reputational mechanisms.

### Founder Equity Estimates

Founder stakes have diluted from approximately 6% each at founding to 2-3% each after multiple funding rounds:[^brand-vision-dario-net-worth]

[^brand-vision-dario-net-worth]: Brand Vision. "Dario Amodei Net Worth in 2025." https://www.brandvm.com/post/dario-amodei-net-worth-in-2025

| Scenario | Est. Stake per Founder | Value per Founder | Total Founder Wealth (7) | 80% Pledge Value |
|----------|------------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Current (\$380B) | 2-3% | \$7.6-11.4B | \$53-80B | \$43-64B |
| Conservative (\$183B) | 2-3% | \$3.7-5.5B | \$26-38B | \$21-31B |
| Downside (\$100B) | 2-3% | \$2-3B | \$14-21B | \$11-17B |
| Major correction (\$50B) | 2-3% | \$1-1.5B | \$7-10.5B | \$5.6-8.4B |

### Individual EA Connections

**Strongly documented EA connections (2/7 founders):**

**<EntityLink id="E91">Dario Amodei</EntityLink> (CEO)**:
- 43rd signatory of the Giving What We Can pledge (2010s)
- Wrote guest posts for GiveWell around 2007-2008
- Lived in a group house with <EntityLink id="E156">Holden Karnofsky</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="E220">Paul Christiano</EntityLink>
- Described as "a very early GiveWell fan"[^ea-forum-anthropic-candid]

[^ea-forum-anthropic-candid]: EA Forum. "Anthropic is not being consistently candid about their." https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/53Gc35vDLK2u5nBxP/anthropic-is-not-being-consistently-candid-about-their

**<EntityLink id="E90">Daniela Amodei</EntityLink> (President)**:
- Married to <EntityLink id="E156">Holden Karnofsky</EntityLink>, co-founder of GiveWell and former CEO of <EntityLink id="E552">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>
- Previously expressed commitment to EA in her 2017 wedding announcement
- Karnofsky joined Anthropic in January 2025 as member of technical staff, working on responsible scaling policy and safety planning[^fortune-daniela-husband]

[^fortune-daniela-husband]: Fortune. (2025, February 13). "Anthropic hired president Daniela Amodei husband AI safety responsible scaling." https://fortune.com/2025/02/13/anthropic-hired-president-daniela-amodei-husband-ai-safety-responsible-scaling/

**Safety-focused, EA alignment undocumented (2/7 founders):**

**<EntityLink id="E59">Chris Olah</EntityLink>**: Pioneer in neural network <EntityLink id="E174">interpretability</EntityLink> whose research focus aligns with <EntityLink id="E353">technical AI safety</EntityLink> priorities. No documented Giving What We Can pledge or explicit EA affiliation.

**Jack Clark**: Former Policy Director at <EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink>; co-founded Anthropic with focus on responsible AI development. No documented EA connections beyond the 80% pledge.

**No documented EA connections (3/7 founders):**

**Tom Brown**: Lead author of GPT-3 at OpenAI. No documented EA connections.

**Jared Kaplan**: Chief Science Officer known for scaling laws research. No documented EA connections.

**Sam McCandlish**: Focuses on AI alignment research. No documented EA connections.

**Summary**: 2 of 7 founders (29% of founder equity) have strong documented EA connections. 5 of 7 founders (71% of founder equity) have undocumented EA alignment or may direct donations to causes outside traditional EA priorities.

## EA-Aligned Investor Equity

Two major EA-aligned investors hold significant Anthropic stakes: Jaan Tallinn and Dustin Moskovitz.

### Jaan Tallinn

<EntityLink id="E577">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink>, co-founder of Skype and Kazaa, led Anthropic's Series A at a \$550 million pre-money valuation.[^anthropic-series-a] Tallinn co-founded the <EntityLink id="E523">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk</EntityLink> (CSER) and the <EntityLink id="E528">Future of Life Institute</EntityLink> (FLI), and has funded AI safety organizations.[^semafor-ea-openai]

**Equity estimate:**

| Parameter | Estimate | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Series A investment | \$40-80M | Typical lead investor share of \$124M round |
| Initial stake (post-Series A) | 6-12% | Based on \$674M post-money valuation |
| Dilution through 16 rounds | 60-75% | Typical for early investors through multiple rounds |
| Current estimated stake (optimistic) | 1.5-4% | After dilution, retaining 25-40% of original |
| Value at \$380B (optimistic) | \$5.7-15.2B | Range based on stake uncertainty |

**Conservative adjustment:** Tallinn's publicly reported net worth (≈\$1-2B) is substantially below the optimistic estimate, suggesting either: (a) he sold shares in secondary transactions, (b) public estimates lag Anthropic's valuation growth, or (c) the investment estimate is too high. A conservative estimate assuming partial secondary sales: **\$2-6B** (0.6-1.7% stake).

Tallinn has stated his investment philosophy: "His policy is roughly to 'invest in AI and spend the proceeds on AI safety'... his philanthropy volume is correlated with his net worth, and his philanthropy is more needed in worlds where AI progresses faster."[^lesswrong-jaan-tallinn] He has also expressed ambivalence about Anthropic specifically: "I'm not sure if they should be [dealing with dangerous stuff]. I'm not sure if anyone should be."[^36kr-tallinn]

[^lesswrong-jaan-tallinn]: LessWrong. "Jaan Tallinn user profile." https://www.lesswrong.com/users/jaan

[^36kr-tallinn]: 36Kr. "Article 3472884024679040." https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3472884024679040

### Dustin Moskovitz

<EntityLink id="E436">Dustin Moskovitz</EntityLink>, co-founder of Facebook and Asana, participated in both Anthropic's seed and Series A rounds. In November 2025, Fortune reported that Moskovitz "moved a \$500 million Anthropic stake into a nonprofit vehicle to reinvest returns."[^fortune-moskovitz]

**Equity estimate:**

| Parameter | Estimate | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Seed + Series A investment | \$20-50M | Smaller than lead investor Tallinn |
| Initial stake | 3-8% | Based on investment size and early valuations |
| Current estimated stake | 0.8-2.5% | After dilution through multiple rounds |
| Value at \$380B | \$3-9.5B | Range based on stake uncertainty |
| Confirmed nonprofit transfer | \$500M+ | Reported in Fortune; likely partial stake |

Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna have committed to giving away virtually all their wealth through <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink>. The \$500M nonprofit transfer confirms at least a portion is already legally committed to charitable purposes.

### Other Early Investors

Other early investors with potential EA alignment include Eric Schmidt (participated in seed round; has funded AI safety research but not primarily EA-aligned) and Center for Emerging Risk Research (early investor with explicit existential risk focus).

**Investor equity estimates:**

| Investor | Optimistic Stake | Conservative Stake | Value (Conservative) | Likelihood of EA Direction |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Jaan Tallinn | 1.5-4% (\$5-14B) | 0.6-1.7% (\$2-6B) | \$2-6B | High (70-90%) |
| Dustin Moskovitz | 0.8-2.5% (\$3-9B) | 0.8-2.5% (\$3-9B) | \$3-9B | Very high (90-100%) |
| Other EA-aligned angels | 0.1-0.5% | 0.1-0.3% | \$0.35-1B | Moderate (50%) |
| **Total EA investor equity** | 2.4-7% (\$8-25B) | 1.5-4.5% (\$5-16B) | \$5-16B | — |

## Employee Equity Analysis

### Total Employee Equity Pool

Startups typically reserve 10-20% of equity for employee compensation. Based on Anthropic's growth trajectory:

| Parameter | Estimate | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Total employee option pool | 12-18% | Standard for Series G+ companies |
| Value at \$380B | \$46-68B | Total employee equity |
| Employees as of Dec 2024 | 870-2,847 | Range from different sources |
| Early employees (first 100-150) | 40-60% of pool | Larger individual grants |
| Early employee equity | \$17-38B | First 100-150 employees |

### EA-Aligned Employee Fraction

An EA Forum analysis notes: "a lot of the early employees and higher-ups have EA-ish perspectives... this fraction is expected to decrease among more recent employees."[^ea-forum-frontload-giving]

[^ea-forum-frontload-giving]: EA Forum. "Front-load giving because of Anthropic donors." https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rRBaP7YbXfZibSn3C/front-load-giving-because-of-anthropic-donors

**Estimated EA alignment by employee cohort:**

| Cohort | Headcount | Share of Pool | EA-Aligned % | EA-Aligned Equity |
|--------|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Founding team (2021) | 15-20 | 25-35% | 60-80% | \$6-17B |
| Early hires (2021-2022) | 50-80 | 20-30% | 40-60% | \$3-11B |
| Growth phase (2023-2024) | 200-400 | 15-25% | 15-30% | \$1-5B |
| Recent hires (2025+) | 500-2000 | 10-15% | 5-15% | \$0.2-1B |
| **Total** | 765-2500 | 70-105% | — | \$10-34B |

Note: Percentages may exceed 100% due to additional grants and refreshers for early employees.

### The Matching Program: Historical vs. Current

Anthropic's employee donation matching program has changed significantly:

**Historical program (2021-2024):**
"For most of Anthropic's existence, employees could pledge up to 50% of their equity to nonprofits, with Anthropic matching that 3:1—an unusually strong incentive to pledge money to charity up-front"[^ea-forum-frontload-giving]

- Employee pledges up to 50% of equity to a 501(c)(3)
- Anthropic matches the pledge 3:1 (adds 3x the pledged amount)
- Pledges are legally binding—equity transferred to DAFs
- Example: \$10M equity → pledge 50% (\$5M) → 3:1 match (\$15M) → \$20M total (4x multiplier)

**Current program (2025+):**
Anthropic's careers page now lists **1:1 matching at up to 25% of equity grants**—a reduction from the historical program.[^anthropic-careers]

- Employee pledges up to 25% of equity
- Anthropic matches 1:1 (adds 1x the pledged amount)
- Example: \$10M equity → pledge 25% (\$2.5M) → 1:1 match (\$2.5M) → \$5M total (2x multiplier)

**Implications:**
- Early employees (2021-2024) who locked in under the 3:1 program retain those terms
- New employees face 1:1 at 25%—substantially less generous
- Employee matching estimates (\$21-53B) may overstate contributions from recent hires by 50-70%
- The "legally bound" capital figure primarily reflects early employees under the old program

### Employee Pledge Participation Estimates

| Scenario | EA Employees Participating | Avg Pledge % | Direct Pledges | 3:1 Matching | Total |
|----------|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Conservative | 30% of EA-aligned | 30% avg | \$1-3B | \$3-9B | \$4-12B |
| Base case | 50% of EA-aligned | 40% avg | \$2-7B | \$6-21B | \$8-28B |
| Optimistic | 70% of EA-aligned | 50% avg | \$3.5-12B | \$10.5-36B | \$14-48B |

**Key constraints and uncertainties:**
- Matching only covers 501(c)(3) organizations, excluding policy-focused 501(c)(4)s
- Some employees may prefer to retain flexibility rather than lock in pledges
- Tax optimization may favor post-IPO giving over pre-IPO pledges
- Matching source unclear: Anthropic funds matching from treasury/reserves or equity pool, with unspecified dilution implications
- Program reduced: Matching changed from 3:1 at 50% to 1:1 at 25% for new employees—estimates based on historical program may overstate future flows
- DAF cause allocation flexible: Money in DAFs is legally committed to some 501(c)(3), but donors retain advisory control over which charities receive grants

### Named EA-Connected Employees

**Amanda Askell**: 67th signatory of the GWWC pledge; former spouse of William MacAskill, co-founder of the EA movement. As an early employee focused on AI ethics, likely holds significant equity.[^ea-forum-anthropic-candid]

**<EntityLink id="E156">Holden Karnofsky</EntityLink>**: Joined January 2025 as member of technical staff. As Daniela Amodei's spouse, co-founder of GiveWell, and former CEO of <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink>, represents a connection to EA funding infrastructure. Later hire likely means smaller equity stake but potential influence on donation decisions.

**Kyle Fish**: First full-time AI welfare researcher at a major AI lab.[^transformer-news-ai-welfare]

[^transformer-news-ai-welfare]: Transformer News. "Anthropic AI welfare researcher." https://www.transformernews.ai/p/anthropic-ai-welfare-researcher

### Long-Term Benefit Trust Members

The LTBT includes several members with EA backgrounds who influence company direction:

- **Zach Robinson**: CEO of <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>
- **Neil Buddy Shah**: Former GiveWell Managing Director; CEO of Clinton Health Access Initiative
- **Kanika Bahl**: CEO of Evidence Action (GiveWell top charity)

While Trust members don't directly benefit from equity, their presence signals organizational commitment to EA-aligned values. For detailed analysis of the Trust's governance structure and effectiveness, see <EntityLink id="E407">Long-Term Benefit Trust (Anthropic)</EntityLink>.

### Comparison with OpenAI

For context, OpenAI's restructuring created a different philanthropic vehicle:[^nbc-openai-restructuring]

[^nbc-openai-restructuring]: NBC News. "OpenAI restructuring company structure ChatGPT invest own." https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/openai-restructuring-company-structure-chatgpt-invest-own-rcna240138

| Dimension | Anthropic | OpenAI |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Structure | Public Benefit Corporation | PBC (post-restructuring) |
| Philanthropic stake | Founder pledges (private) | Foundation holds 26% (\$130B) |
| Governance | Long-Term Benefit Trust | Foundation appoints all directors |
| Control mechanism | Trust elects board majority by 2027 | Foundation can replace directors anytime |
| Enforcement | Reputational | Foundation has legal control |

The <EntityLink id="E421">OpenAI Foundation</EntityLink>'s 26% stake at current valuations is worth approximately \$130 billion. Unlike Anthropic's pledge-based model, the OpenAI Foundation has direct legal control.[^inside-philanthropy-openai]

[^inside-philanthropy-openai]: Inside Philanthropy. "OpenAI now has a foundation we have some questions." https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/openai-now-has-a-foundation-we-have-some-questions

## The FTX Stake: A Case Study

FTX invested approximately \$500 million for a 13.56% stake in Anthropic before its November 2022 bankruptcy. Due to subsequent funding rounds, this diluted to approximately 7.84% by 2024.[^cnbc-ftx-anthropic]

[^cnbc-ftx-anthropic]: CNBC. (2024, March 25). "FTX estate sells majority stake in startup Anthropic for 884 million." https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/ftx-estate-sells-majority-stake-in-startup-anthropic-for-884-million.html

### Bankruptcy Sale

The FTX bankruptcy estate sold the stake in two tranches:

| Tranche | Date | Amount | Price/Share | Buyers |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| First (2/3 of stake) | [March 2024](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/ftx-estate-sells-majority-stake-in-startup-anthropic-for-884-million.html) | \$884M | ≈\$20 | Mubadala (≈\$500M), Jane Street, HOF Capital, Ford Foundation, Fidelity |
| Second (remaining) | Late 2024 | \$452M | \$30 | G Squared (lead), others |
| **Total** | — | \$1.34B | — | — |

**Outcome**: 2.7x return on \$500M investment, but proceeds went to FTX creditors rather than EA-aligned causes. Had FTX not collapsed, this stake would be worth approximately \$27 billion at current valuations—capital that might have flowed to EA causes given SBF's stated intentions.

## IPO Timeline and Liquidity

Anthropic is preparing for a potential 2026-2027 IPO, having hired Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in December 2025 and initiated bank discussions. Key facts relevant to philanthropic funding flows:

- **Timeline**: Late 2026 possible but uncertain; prediction markets favor mid-2027
- **Probability**: Kalshi assigns 72% chance Anthropic IPOs before OpenAI
- **Revenue trajectory**: \$1B → \$9B+ ARR in 2025; targeting \$26B in 2026
- **Liquidity events**: First employee buyback in March 2025 at \$61.5B valuation[^maginative-buyback]

An IPO would enable founder and employee share sales. Lock-up periods (typically 6-12 months post-IPO) would delay capital deployment until 2027-2028 at earliest.

*See <EntityLink id="E409">Anthropic IPO</EntityLink> for comprehensive analysis of preparation status, competitive dynamics, valuation trajectory, and detailed timeline estimates.*

### Alternative Exit: Acquisition

Anthropic could be acquired rather than IPO, with implications for EA-aligned capital:

**Potential acquirers:**
- **Google** (14% stake): Largest strategic investor; acquisition would face antitrust scrutiny
- **Amazon** (\$10.75B invested): Primary cloud partner; similar antitrust concerns
- **Microsoft**: Recent partnership; diversifying from OpenAI dependency
- **Apple, Meta**: Less likely but possible as AI competition intensifies

**Acquisition implications:**
- Immediate liquidity for all shareholders (no lock-up periods)
- Valuation might be at premium or discount to public market estimates
- Long-Term Benefit Trust governance provisions would be tested
- Strategic acquirer might impose restrictions on founder/employee share sales
- Regulatory approval could take 12-24+ months given current antitrust climate

**Probability estimate**: Acquisition before 2028 is approximately 15-25% likely, based on regulatory barriers and Anthropic's stated preference for independence.

### Valuation Uncertainty

The \$380B valuation reflects the closed Series G round (February 2026).[^anthropic-series-g] Secondary market data from late 2025 showed variation:

| Source | Implied Valuation | Date |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| Series G (closed) | \$380B | Feb 2026 |
| Series G term sheet | \$350B | Jan 2026 |
| [Hiive secondary](https://www.premieralts.com/companies/anthropic/secondary-market-price) | \$340B | Dec 2025 |
| [Forge Global secondary](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/anthropic-upcoming-ipo-news/) | \$300B | Dec 2025 |

All estimates in this analysis use \$380B for consistency with the closed round.

### Employee Lockup Period Implications

Post-IPO lockup periods are a significant constraint on employee liquidity and, by extension, on the timing of EA-aligned capital deployment. During the lockup window, employees and other insiders are contractually prohibited from selling shares on the public market.

**Standard lockup structure:** Most tech IPOs impose a 180-day (6-month) lockup, though some extend to 12 months. Many recent tech IPOs have adopted tiered or staged lockup expirations rather than a single cliff:[^sec-lockup-overview]

[^sec-lockup-overview]: SEC. "Lock-Up Agreements in IPOs." https://www.sec.gov/education/capitalraising/building-blocks/lockup-agreements

| Release Schedule | Share % Released | Typical Timing |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| First tranche | 15-25% of insider shares | 90 days post-IPO |
| Second tranche | 25-40% | 180 days post-IPO |
| Final tranche | Remaining shares | 270-365 days post-IPO |

Whether Anthropic would adopt a single 180-day cliff or a staged release is unknown. Staged releases reduce selling pressure on the stock but extend the period before employees have full liquidity.

**Impact on employee donation pledges:** Employees who transferred equity to DAFs under the 3:1 matching program hold shares that are legally committed to charity but cannot be liquidated during the lockup. This creates a gap between legal commitment and actual capital deployment:

- DAFs holding Anthropic shares cannot convert to cash grants during the lockup
- Employees who pledged but haven't yet transferred to DAFs cannot sell to fund transfers
- The 3:1 matching pool (held by Anthropic) is similarly illiquid during this period
- Net effect: \$20-40B in legally bound employee capital is delayed by 6-12 months post-IPO

**Stock price risk during lockup:** If the share price declines during the lockup window, employee wealth—and thus the value of pledged donations—decreases before employees can act. Historical data shows significant post-IPO price volatility in tech stocks:[^renaissance-capital-lockup]

[^renaissance-capital-lockup]: Renaissance Capital. "IPO Lock-Up Expirations and Insider Selling." https://www.renaissancecapital.com/review/IPOLockUpReport.aspx

- Average tech IPO stock price change during the 180-day lockup period: -5% to +15% (wide variance)
- At Anthropic's scale, a 20% decline during lockup would reduce employee equity value by \$9-14B, directly reducing the value of pledged donations
- Conversely, price appreciation during lockup increases eventual donation value but employees bear the risk of not being able to lock in gains

**Buyback as partial mitigation:** The March 2025 employee buyback provided limited pre-IPO liquidity but with significant constraints:[^maginative-buyback]

| Constraint | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Eligibility | 2+ years tenure (excludes recent hires) |
| Volume cap | Up to 20% of vested equity per employee |
| Dollar cap | \$2 million maximum per employee |
| Price | \$56.09/share (\$61.5B valuation)—now worth 6x more at \$380B |

For an early employee with \$20M in equity, the buyback allowed selling \$2M (10%)—useful for immediate needs but leaving 90%+ locked until IPO. Employees who sold at \$61.5B valuation captured only a fraction of the value growth to \$380B. Future buyback rounds, if offered, would provide additional pre-IPO liquidity but have not been announced.

**Secondary market restrictions:** Unlike outside investors who can freely trade on platforms like Forge Global and Hiive, employees typically face company-imposed transfer restrictions:[^forge-anthropic-ipo]

- Most private companies require board approval for employee secondary sales
- Anthropic's specific policy is not publicly documented
- Even where allowed, secondary sales may be limited to specific windows and buyer pools
- Employees generally cannot access the \$270-302/share secondary market prices shown above without company approval

**Net effect on EA capital timing:** The lockup period adds 6-12 months to the already uncertain IPO timeline, pushing significant employee capital deployment to 2027-2028 at earliest. Combined with the reduced matching program for newer employees, this reinforces that the legally bound early-employee capital (\$20-40B in DAFs under the old 3:1 program) remains the most reliable near-term source of EA-aligned funding from Anthropic.

## Historical Evidence on Pledge Fulfillment

*For comprehensive analysis of the <EntityLink id="E531">Giving Pledge</EntityLink> and billionaire philanthropy patterns, see <EntityLink id="E531">Giving Pledge</EntityLink>.*

### Giving Pledge Track Record

The Giving Pledge, founded in 2010 by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, provides the most relevant historical comparison. A 2025 Institute for Policy Studies analysis reveals:[^ips-giving-pledge]

**Deceased pledgers (n=22):**
- Met 50% threshold: 8 (36%)
- Did not meet threshold: 13 (59%)
- Lost fortune before death: 1 (5%)

**Living original pledgers:**
- Only Laura and John Arnold have exceeded 50% giving during their lifetimes
- Original 32 U.S. pledgers still billionaires saw wealth increase 283% (166% inflation-adjusted)
- Five pledgers experienced wealth increases exceeding 500%
- Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's wealth grew over 4,000%

**Where the money goes:**
- Private foundations: 80% of \$206B total
- Donor-advised funds: ≈\$5B
- Working charities: ≈\$40B (20%)

These patterns suggest that even honored pledges may not reach working organizations for years or decades.

### Age and Cohort Effects

The IPS analysis suggests older pledgers or those near billionaire threshold were more likely to fulfill commitments. Of 11 original pledgers no longer billionaires, 7 gave sufficiently to drop below threshold. This may be relevant to Anthropic founders, who are relatively young (30s-40s).

An EA Forum comment notes: "Maintaining altruistic giving after sudden wealth is really difficult. There are surprisingly few cases of young people (under 40) giving away millions after a cash windfall."[^ea-forum-frontload-giving]

### Facebook/Meta Comparison

The 2012 Facebook IPO created thousands of employee millionaires. Evidence on their philanthropy:[^chronicle-philanthropy-facebook]

[^chronicle-philanthropy-facebook]: Chronicle of Philanthropy. (2012). "Charities Seek Some of." https://philanthropy.com/article/Charities-Seek-Some-of/156577

- Dustin Moskovitz: \$4B+ donated through Good Ventures/Coefficient Giving
- Most other early employees: Limited public philanthropic activity
- Studies suggest tech entrepreneurs give approximately 2x more than inherited wealth, but absolute rates remain modest

## Comprehensive Funding Flow Model

Previous estimates focused only on founder equity (\$39-59B at current valuation). This understates total EA-aligned capital by excluding EA-aligned investors (Tallinn, Moskovitz) and employee pledges with 3:1 matching.

### All Sources of EA-Aligned Capital at \$380B Valuation

**Optimistic scenario** (uses historical matching terms, optimistic Tallinn estimate, counts all 7 founders as EA-aligned):

| Source | Equity Stake | Gross Value | EA-Directed % | EA-Directed Value |
|--------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Founders (7)** | 14-21% | \$49-74B | 80% (pledged) | \$39-59B |
| **Jaan Tallinn** | 1.5-4% | \$5-14B | 70-90% | \$4-13B |
| **Dustin Moskovitz** | 0.8-2.5% | \$3-9B | 90-100% | \$3-9B |
| **Other EA investors** | 0.1-0.5% | \$0.35-1.75B | 50% | \$0.2-0.9B |
| **Employee pledges** | 2-5% | \$7-18B | 100% (legally bound) | \$7-18B |
| **3:1 matching** | 6-15% | \$21-53B | 100% (legally bound) | \$21-53B |
| **Non-pledged EA employees** | 1-3% | \$3.5-10.5B | 30-50% | \$1-5B |
| **Total (optimistic)** | 25-51% | \$89-180B | — | \$75-158B |

**Conservative adjustments:**

| Factor | Optimistic | Conservative | Reduction Rationale |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Tallinn stake | \$4-13B | \$1.6-5.4B | Possible secondary sales; public net worth suggests lower holdings |
| Non-strongly-EA founders (5/7, 71% of equity) | Count as EA | Exclude | Only 2/7 founders have documented strong EA connections |
| Matching (1:1@25% for new hires) | Full 3:1@50% | 50% reduction for 2025+ cohort | Program reduced for new employees |
| **Total conservative** | \$75-158B | \$30-70B | — |

**Recommended planning range:**
- **Optimistic** (all founders count as EA-aligned): \$75-158B gross, \$56-70B risk-adjusted
- **Conservative** (only 2/7 strongly EA-aligned founders): \$30-70B gross, \$25-50B risk-adjusted
- **For planning purposes, use: \$25-70B risk-adjusted**, acknowledging the wide range reflects genuine uncertainty about cause allocation

### Scenario Analysis: Total EA-Aligned Capital

| Scenario | Valuation | Founders | Investors | Employees + Match | Total EA Capital |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Bull** | \$500B | \$56-84B | \$10-33B | \$42-109B | \$108-226B |
| **Base** | \$380B | \$43-64B | \$7.6-25B | \$32-83B | \$82-172B |
| **Conservative** | \$150B | \$17-25B | \$3-10B | \$13-33B | \$33-68B |
| **Bear** | \$50B | \$5.6-8.4B | \$1-3B | \$4-11B | \$11-22B |
| **Failure** | \$0 | \$0 | \$0 | \$0 | \$0 |

Note: This table uses optimistic assumptions (all 7 founders counted as EA-aligned). Conservative estimates would reduce founder contributions by approximately 60%.

### Extended Growth Scenarios (2-10x)

Given Anthropic's trajectory—revenue growing from \$1B to \$9B in 2025, enterprise market position, and potential AGI premium—higher valuations are plausible:

| Scenario | Valuation | Multiple | Probability | Key Drivers |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Extended Bull** | \$700B | 2x | 10-15% | Sustained 3x annual revenue growth, 40x forward multiple, enterprise dominance |
| **Market Dominance** | \$1T | 2.9x | 5-10% | Winner-take-most dynamics, AI platform leader, \$70B+ revenue |
| **Exceptional** | \$1.75T | 5x | 2-5% | AGI proximity signals, infrastructure-level adoption |
| **AGI Premium** | \$3.5T | 10x | 1-3% | First-mover AGI advantage, platform monopoly effects |

**Historical precedent**: Nvidia's valuation increased approximately 15x from 2020-2024 as it became the dominant AI infrastructure provider. If Anthropic achieves similar positioning in AI applications/models, comparable multiples are possible.

**Extended EA Capital Estimates:**

| Scenario | Valuation | Founders (80%) | Investors | Employees + Match | Total EA Capital (Optimistic) |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Extended Bull | \$700B | \$78-118B | \$14-46B | \$59-153B | \$151-317B |
| Dominance | \$1T | \$112-168B | \$20-66B | \$84-218B | \$216-452B |
| Exceptional | \$1.75T | \$196-294B | \$35-116B | \$147-382B | \$378-792B |
| AGI Premium | \$3.5T | \$392-588B | \$70-231B | \$294-764B | \$756-1,580B |

At 10x current valuation (\$3.5T), total EA-aligned capital could exceed \$1 trillion under optimistic assumptions—though probability-weighted, this adds only \$8-16B to expected value given low likelihood.

### Expected Value Calculation

**Probability-weighted EA capital (optimistic assumptions—all 7 founders counted as EA-aligned):**

| Scenario | Probability | Midpoint (Optimistic) | Expected Value |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Bull | 15% | \$167B | \$25B |
| Base | 40% | \$127B | \$51B |
| Conservative | 25% | \$50B | \$12.5B |
| Bear | 15% | \$17B | \$2.5B |
| Failure | 5% | \$0 | \$0 |
| **Total (optimistic)** | **100%** | — | **\$91B** |

**With conservative founder assumptions (only 2/7 strongly EA-aligned):**
- Reduce founder contribution by approximately 60%
- Adjusted expected value: **\$48-58B**

**Final recommended range**: \$27-76B risk-adjusted, depending on assumptions about founder EA alignment and cause allocation.

### Adjusting for Pledge Fulfillment Risk

Different capital sources have different fulfillment reliability:

| Source | Gross Expected | Fulfillment Rate | Risk-Adjusted |
|--------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Strongly EA-aligned founders (2/7) | \$11-17B | 50-70% | \$6-12B |
| Safety-focused founders (2/7) | \$11-17B | 30-50% (uncertain cause) | \$3-8B |
| Non-EA founders (3/7) | \$17-25B | 10-30% (unlikely EA) | \$2-7B |
| Tallinn (conservative) | \$2-6B | 70-90% | \$1.4-5.4B |
| Moskovitz | \$3-9B | 90-100% | \$2.7-9B |
| Employee pledges + match | \$20-40B | 80-95% (legally bound, cause flexible) | \$16-38B |
| Non-pledged EA employees | \$2B | 20-40% | \$0.4-0.8B |
| **Total (optimistic)** | \$66-116B | — | \$31-80B |
| **Total (conservative, EA-only)** | \$36-72B | — | \$25-65B |

**Key finding**: Employee pledges and matching are **legally binding** (equity already transferred to DAFs), making them more reliable than founder pledges which face Giving Pledge-style fulfillment risk.

### Capital by Reliability Tier

| Tier | Sources | Amount | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Legally bound** | Employee pledges, matching, Moskovitz nonprofit transfer | \$25-50B | Already in DAFs/nonprofits; reduced for program changes |
| **High likelihood** | Tallinn (conservative), committed EA employees | \$3-10B | Track record of giving; Tallinn may have sold shares |
| **Pledge-dependent** | Strongly EA-aligned founder pledges (2/7 founders) | \$6-12B | Subject to Giving Pledge risk; only Dario and Daniela |
| **Uncertain** | Safety-focused founders (2/7), non-EA founders (3/7), non-pledged employees, other investors | \$15-40B | May flow to non-EA causes or causes outside traditional EA priorities |

### Timing Analysis

Capital availability depends on:
1. **IPO timing** (2026-2028 most likely)
2. **Lock-up periods** (typically 6-12 months post-IPO)
3. **Founder decision timing** (immediate vs. gradual over decades)
4. **Foundation vs. direct giving** (foundations delay deployment)
5. **Employee liquidity** (buybacks provide early access; first occurred March 2025[^maginative-buyback])

**Timeline estimates by source:**

| Source | Earliest | Peak Flow | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Employee pledges (DAF) | 2025-2026 | 2027-2030 | Already transferring; IPO unlocks full value |
| Moskovitz | 2026-2027 | 2027-2030 | Nonprofit vehicle already established |
| Tallinn | 2027-2028 | 2028-2032 | Likely post-IPO, gradual |
| Founders | 2028-2030 | 2030-2040 | Younger age suggests longer timeline |

Realistic timeline for significant capital deployment: **2027-2035**, with legally-bound employee capital arriving earliest.

### Model Limitations and Caveats

This analysis contains significant uncertainties:

**Potential double-counting:**
- The 3:1 matching pool must come from company equity reserves or founder dilution. If matching comes from founder equity, the "Founders" and "Matching" rows may partially overlap.
- Some employee pledges may come from employees who are also counted as "EA-aligned" in other categories.

**Overestimate risks:**
- **Tallinn stake**: Optimistic estimate (\$5-14B) implies wealth far exceeding reported net worth (≈\$1-2B), suggesting possible secondary sales. Conservative estimate: \$2-6B.
- **EA alignment assumption**: Analysis assumes most early employee pledges will flow to EA causes, but DAF donors retain discretion. Some may fund universities, hospitals, or non-EA charities.
- **Limited strong EA connections among founders**: Only 2 of 7 founders (Dario and Daniela Amodei) have documented strong EA connections. This means **71% of founder equity** may flow to causes outside traditional EA priorities.
- **Matching program reduced**: The program changed from 3:1 at 50% to **1:1 at 25%** for new employees. Matching estimates (\$21-53B) may overstate contributions from 2025+ hires by 50-70%.
- **DAF cause allocation flexible**: Money in DAFs is legally committed to some 501(c)(3), but donors retain advisory control over which charities receive grants.

**Underestimate risks:**
- Additional EA-aligned employees not captured in estimates
- Founders may donate more than 80%
- Valuation could exceed \$380B at IPO

**Structural uncertainties:**
- **Valuation basis**: \$380B is a closed Series G round figure
- **Acquisition scenario**: 15-25% probability of acquisition before IPO, with different implications for liquidity timing
- **AI industry risk**: Regulatory action, technical setbacks, or competition could reduce valuation

**Recommendation**: Use the **risk-adjusted range of \$27-76B** for planning purposes, acknowledging that actual outcomes could fall outside this range in either direction.

## Cause Allocation Uncertainty

### Likely Beneficiaries

**High probability (AI safety/technical alignment):**
- Anthropic's mission alignment suggests AI safety focus
- Founders' technical backgrounds suggest interest in technical research
- <EntityLink id="E91">Dario Amodei</EntityLink>'s background in ML research
- An EA Forum comment notes mechanistic interpretability research expects "an influx of funding soon"[^ea-forum-frontload-giving]

**Moderate probability (EA-adjacent):**
- Global health (Dario's early GiveWell involvement)
- Pandemic preparedness/biosecurity (Anthropic's risk-focused culture)
- <EntityLink id="E154">AI governance and policy</EntityLink>
- AI welfare research (Anthropic hired Kyle Fish in 2024 as first full-time AI welfare researcher[^transformer-news-ai-welfare])

**Lower probability:**
- Animal welfare: EA community surveys suggest 18-24% of resources should go to animal advocacy while actual allocation is approximately 7%[^ea-forum-animal-underfunding]
- Digital minds: Neglected area with few researchers
- Non-EA causes (inequality, climate): Dario's essay mentions inequality concerns but unclear if this translates to non-EA giving

[^ea-forum-animal-underfunding]: EA Forum. "EA is underfunding animal advocacy according to our own." https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FxZdQJXs45fTFnMEe/ea-is-underfunding-animal-advocacy-according-to-our-own

**Policy-focused organizations (501(c)(4)s):**
- Americans for Responsible Innovation (ARI): AI policy advocacy
- AI Policy Network: Political donations for AI safety
- Note: Anthropic's matching program only covers 501(c)(3)s, limiting incentives for policy donations

### Donor Advising Ecosystem

Several organizations are positioning to advise Anthropic equity holders:[^ea-forum-flush-future]

[^ea-forum-flush-future]: EA Forum. "Preparing for a flush future work giving and conduct." https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H8SqwbLxKkiJur3c4/preparing-for-a-flush-future-work-giving-and-conduct

| Organization | Focus | Scale |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| <EntityLink id="E542">Longview Philanthropy</EntityLink> | AI safety, GCR; donors >\$100k/year | \$60M+ advised in 2025, scaling to \$100M+ in 2026 |
| GiveWell | Global health | \$1B+ annually |
| <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> | EA cause areas broadly | Largest EA funder |
| Senterra Funders | Animal welfare | Emerging |

One EA Forum commenter noted their job "involves a non-zero amount of advising Anthropic folks" on donation decisions.

### Differential Impact by Cause

From EA Forum analysis:[^ea-forum-frontload-giving]

> "AI safety likely receives more Anthropic employee funding, while global health and animal welfare are relatively neglected within the Anthropic giving community."

### Scale Relative to Existing EA Funding

| Metric | Current EA Funding | Anthropic-Derived (Est.) | Multiple |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Current | ≈\$1B/year | — | — |
| Conservative (\$150B val) | ≈\$1B/year | +\$33-68B | 33-68x one-time |
| Base case (\$380B val) | ≈\$1B/year | +\$82-172B | 82-172x one-time |
| Risk-adjusted base | ≈\$1B/year | +\$48-76B | 48-76x one-time |
| If deployed over 10 years | ≈\$1B/year | +\$4.8-7.6B/year | 4.8-7.6x ongoing |

Note: Previous estimates using founder equity only showed \$39-59B; the comprehensive model including investors and employees is 2-2.5x larger.

### Front-Loading vs. Waiting

Arguments for current donors giving now:[^ea-forum-frontload-giving]

> "A \$100k gift represents 9% of current funding versus only 1% of projected future funding... organizations become less constrained by money than capacity."

Arguments for waiting:
- Coordination may avoid redundant capacity building
- Current giving has higher certainty of impact
- Anthropic wealth remains uncertain

### Absorption Capacity Concerns

Whether the AI safety and broader EA ecosystem can productively absorb billions in additional funding remains unclear:

- **Talent constraints**: Top researchers are scarce; funding doesn't create talent
- **Organizational scaling**: Rapid growth often reduces effectiveness
- **Grant evaluation**: Evaluating \$50B+ requires infrastructure that doesn't exist
- **Diminishing returns**: Best opportunities get funded first
- **Potential for reduced rigor**: Easy money may lower standards

## Governance and Accountability

### Long-Term Benefit Trust

Anthropic's <EntityLink id="E407">Long-Term Benefit Trust</EntityLink> (LTBT) provides some mission accountability through five financially disinterested trustees with growing board appointment power (majority by 2027). However, critics note stockholder override provisions and the Trust's limited use of its appointment power to date. See the dedicated page for full analysis.

### Pledge Enforcement

Unlike the OpenAI Foundation's legal control over board appointments, Anthropic founder pledges have no legal enforcement mechanism:
- Pledges are public commitments, not contracts
- Enforcement relies on reputational cost
- No third-party oversight of fulfillment
- Founders retain full discretion on timing, vehicles, and recipients

For analysis of interventions that could increase pledge fulfillment probability—including legal pledge conversion, DAF pre-commitment campaigns, and public accountability tracking—see <EntityLink id="E411">Anthropic Founder Pledge Interventions</EntityLink>.

## Prediction Markets

A [Manifold Markets prediction market](https://manifold.markets/MichaelDickens/by-the-end-of-2030-how-much-anthrop) asks: "By the end of 2030, how much Anthropic money will have been donated to charity?" The market covers donations from all Anthropic-derived wealth, including individual donations from founders and employees who gained wealth through equity, as well as company matching contributions.

| Outcome Bracket | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|
| \$0 | No significant donations before 2030 |
| \<\$100M | Token giving only |
| \$100M–\$1B | Modest fulfillment; comparable to early employee buyback-era giving |
| \$1B–\$3B | Partial pledge fulfillment; likely employee DAF distributions |
| \$3B–\$10B | Substantial giving; consistent with legally bound employee capital arriving post-IPO |
| \$10B–\$30B | Near full deployment of legally bound capital plus some founder giving |
| \>\$30B | Exceeds most conservative risk-adjusted estimates for this timeline |

This market provides a useful external reference point for the estimates on this page. The risk-adjusted range of \$27-76B estimated above covers total eventual EA-aligned capital, but much of that is expected to deploy over 2027-2035. By end of 2030, actual donations may be substantially lower than the total eventual figure, depending on IPO timing, lock-up periods, and founder decision timelines.

## Key Uncertainties Summary

| Uncertainty | Range | Key Drivers |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| IPO timing | 2026-2030+ | Market conditions, regulatory, company choice |
| IPO valuation | \$50B-\$500B+ | AI market, revenue growth, competition |
| Founder pledge fulfillment | 40-60% | Historical Giving Pledge base rates |
| Employee pledge fulfillment | 90-100% | Already legally bound in DAFs |
| Investor giving (Tallinn/Moskovitz) | 80-100% | Strong track record, some already committed |
| Cause allocation | Concentrated-Diverse | AI safety favored; other causes uncertain |
| Deployment timeline | 5-30 years | Foundation vs. direct, tax optimization |
| EA absorption capacity | \$5-15B/year | Talent, organizations, evaluation infrastructure |
| Employee EA fraction decline | Moderate-High | Early hires more EA-aligned than recent |
