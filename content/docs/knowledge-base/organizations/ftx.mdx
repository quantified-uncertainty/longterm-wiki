## Overview

FTX was a centralized cryptocurrency exchange platform that, at its peak in 2021–2022, ranked as the third-largest crypto exchange by trading volume globally. Founded in May 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried (commonly known as SBF), Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh, FTX offered spot trading, derivatives (futures and options), leveraged tokens, NFT trading, and custody of digital assets across more than 275 trading pairs.[^1] It operated a separate U.S.-focused entity, FTX.US, and was incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda with its principal offices in the Bahamas. At its height, FTX had over one million active users, processed approximately \$10–16 billion in daily trading volume, and attracted a \$32 billion valuation.[^2]

The exchange formed the core of what observers described as a "crypto conglomerate," including FTX itself, the affiliated quantitative trading firm Alameda Research (also founded by Bankman-Fried), and the native FTT utility token launched in 2019. These interconnections, largely opaque to users and investors alike, ultimately proved catastrophic. In early November 2022, a leaked balance sheet revealed that Alameda Research's assets were heavily concentrated in FTT tokens — an illiquid, FTX-issued instrument — and that customer deposits had allegedly been lent to Alameda without disclosure. A bank run ensued, and FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11, 2022, with an estimated \$8–9 billion in customer funds missing.[^3]

For the AI safety community and the broader effective altruism (EA) ecosystem, the collapse carried particular significance. Bankman-Fried had directed substantial philanthropic resources toward AI safety research, and the FTX Future Fund had committed tens of millions of dollars to organizations working on existential risk from advanced AI. The sudden disappearance of this funding stream, and the reputational damage to EA-adjacent networks, reverberated through the AI safety field in ways that are still being processed.[^4]

## History

### Founding and Early Growth (2017–2020)

Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang founded Alameda Research in October 2017 as a quantitative cryptocurrency trading firm and hedge fund.[^5] Drawing on arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets, Alameda grew rapidly and served as the operational and financial seedbed for FTX. FTX Trading Ltd. was formally launched in May 2019 by Bankman-Fried, Wang, and Nishad Singh as a derivatives-focused exchange offering futures, options, and leveraged tokens — products that were relatively novel in the crypto industry at the time.[^6] Also in 2019, FTX issued its native token FTT, which provided trading fee discounts and staking rewards, and was accepted as collateral for margin loans on the platform — a structural feature that would later become central to the exchange's collapse.[^7]

FTX's early products attracted professional and institutional traders seeking sophisticated instruments, while its marketing positioned it as a "safe, easy way to get into crypto" for retail participants.[^8] The exchange also operated a market-making relationship with Alameda Research, which acted as FTX's primary liquidity provider — an arrangement common in crypto markets but one that created significant conflicts of interest.

### Rapid Expansion and Peak (2021–Early 2022)

By July 2021, FTX had accumulated over one million active users and raised more than \$1.8 billion from prominent venture capital investors including SoftBank and Sequoia Capital.[^9] A subsequent funding round in January 2022 raised an additional \$400 million, valuing the exchange at approximately \$32 billion.[^10] The FTT token reached an all-time high price of around \$85 during the 2021 bull market, and Bankman-Fried emerged as one of the most prominent figures in the crypto industry, frequently appearing before U.S. congressional committees and cultivating an image as a responsible, reform-minded exchange operator.

In late 2021, Bankman-Fried stepped down as CEO of Alameda Research. Caroline Ellison and Sam Trabucco were appointed co-CEOs, with Ellison becoming sole CEO by mid-2022.[^11] Despite this nominal separation of leadership, substantial organizational and financial ties between FTX and Alameda remained — and, as later proceedings revealed, customer deposits were being transferred to Alameda throughout this period.

FTX also expanded aggressively in the U.S. market: FTX.US won an auction for the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital at approximately \$1.42 billion in September 2022, a transaction that was later unwound by Binance for approximately \$1 billion following FTX's collapse.[^12]

### The Collapse (November 2022)

The chain of events that destroyed FTX unfolded over roughly ten days in November 2022. On November 2, 2022, the crypto news outlet CoinDesk published a report revealing that approximately 40 percent of Alameda Research's balance sheet consisted of FTT tokens — an illiquid asset issued by FTX itself — raising acute concerns about the financial health of both entities and their entanglement.[^13]

On November 6, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (known as CZ) publicly announced that Binance would liquidate its approximately \$580 million in FTT holdings, citing risk management considerations. The announcement triggered a classic bank run: approximately \$6 billion in withdrawal requests flooded FTX within days, overwhelming its liquidity.[^14] FTX halted customer withdrawals on November 8, the same day it entered a non-binding acquisition agreement with Binance. The FTT token lost approximately 80 percent of its value almost immediately, erasing approximately \$2 billion in market capitalization.[^15]

Binance terminated the proposed acquisition on November 9 after its due diligence team found evidence of misappropriated customer funds and regulatory investigations. On November 11, 2022, FTX, FTX.US, and approximately 130 affiliated entities filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States District Court for Delaware. Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO and was replaced by restructuring specialist John J. Ray III. Shortly after the bankruptcy filing, approximately \$477 million in funds were reported stolen in what was described as an unauthorized transfer — with the funds converted to Ether — in what observers characterized as either a hack or an inside job.[^16]

Federal prosecutors in New York opened a criminal investigation into FTX's collapse on November 14, 2022. Bankman-Fried was arrested in the Bahamas in December 2022 on charges including wire fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, and violations of campaign finance law.[^17]

### Legal Proceedings and Bankruptcy (2023–2025)

At trial in November 2023, Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on all fraud and money laundering counts. In March 2024, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.[^18] Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang both pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors. Wang had allegedly coded a backdoor into FTX's systems that gave Alameda special privileges — including the ability to maintain a negative balance — which he acknowledged was illegal.[^19]

The bankruptcy proceedings advanced substantially through 2024. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered FTX to pay \$12.7 billion in relief to customers: \$8.7 billion in restitution and \$4 billion in disgorgement, as announced by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).[^20] The Chapter 11 reorganization plan received court approval in October 2024. In December 2024, FTX announced that its Plan of Reorganization would become effective January 3, 2025, with initial distributions targeting "Convenience Classes" — creditors with claims of \$50,000 or less — via partnerships with custodian BitGo and exchange Kraken.[^21]

A notable controversy in the bankruptcy process concerns the valuation of repayments: creditors are to receive cash payouts pegged to cryptocurrency prices as of November 11, 2022 — a period of depressed valuations, with Bitcoin priced around \$17,000 — rather than crypto-in-kind or amounts reflecting subsequent market recovery. This arrangement has drawn objections from creditors and their legal representatives.[^22]

In November 2024, FTX's bankruptcy estate also filed a lawsuit against Binance and former CEO Changpeng Zhao for approximately \$1.8 billion, related to Binance's sale of its equity stake in FTX in 2021.[^23]

## Structure and Operations

FTX operated as a centralized exchange, meaning it held custody of user assets on its own balance sheet rather than facilitating purely peer-to-peer transactions. Users deposited cryptocurrencies or fiat currency into FTX-controlled wallets and traded through a central limit order book that matched buyers and sellers. The exchange charged transaction fees as its primary revenue source and offered tiered fee structures through its VIP program, with high-volume traders receiving preferential rates.[^24]

The native FTT token served several functions: it provided trading fee discounts, enabled staking for interest earnings, and — critically — was accepted as collateral for margin loans. The Richmond Federal Reserve's economic analysis noted that FTX's acceptance of its own token as collateral created what economists describe as "wrong-way risk" and liquidity spirals: in a downturn, the value of FTT and the creditworthiness of FTX-related entities would decline simultaneously, making the collateral worthless precisely when it was most needed.[^25]

Alameda Research, while nominally independent, functioned as FTX's primary market maker and had access to a unique line of credit on the FTX platform — reportedly unlimited and not subject to the liquidation rules that applied to ordinary traders. This arrangement, later revealed in bankruptcy proceedings, allowed Alameda to borrow billions of dollars from FTX using customer deposits as an undisclosed funding source.[^26]

## Governance Failures

Post-collapse investigations and bankruptcy proceedings revealed governance arrangements that were, by ordinary corporate standards, extraordinarily deficient. FTX apparently lacked functioning internal controls of virtually any kind: board meetings were not held regularly, employee records were inadequately maintained, and financial files were set to auto-delete after fixed periods.[^27] Expenses were reportedly approved via emoji reactions in chat programs. There was no effective audit function, no independent oversight board, and no documented process for managing the transfer of funds between FTX and Alameda.

These failures allowed Bankman-Fried to operate what the bankruptcy trustee described as secret backdoor bookkeeping systems — mechanisms that transferred customer funds to Alameda without notifying either customers or, according to at least some accounts, senior FTX employees.[^28] When the exchange's new CEO, John J. Ray III — who had previously overseen the Enron bankruptcy — reviewed FTX's records, he described the situation as unlike anything he had encountered in his decades of restructuring work, noting a complete absence of trustworthy financial information.

## Relevance to AI Safety

### FTX's Funding of AI Safety Research

FTX's relevance to the AI safety community stems primarily from Bankman-Fried's substantial philanthropic commitments to existential risk reduction and AI safety research, driven by his public identification with effective altruism and longtermism. According to reporting from DeepLearning.AI, FTX provided over \$530 million to more than 70 AI-related organizations.[^29]

The most prominent beneficiary was <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink>, which reportedly received \$500 million from FTX-affiliated sources toward developing its AI systems.[^30] The FTX Future Fund — a philanthropic vehicle launched by FTX executives, with <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>-adjacent figures on its board — allocated approximately \$30 million specifically to AI safety projects and \$6 million to efforts addressing risks from large language models such as misinformation generation.[^31] William MacAskill, a philosopher closely associated with the EA movement, served on the FTX Future Fund board; he and his colleagues resigned on November 10, 2022, as the collapse became apparent.[^32]

The FTX Future Fund's grants supported a range of organizations working on AI governance, alignment research, and existential risk mitigation. Leopold Aschenbrenner, who had previously worked at the FTX Future Fund after co-founding Columbia University's EA chapter, later joined <EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink>'s superalignment team.

### Impact of the Collapse on AI Safety Funding

The collapse raised immediate concerns about clawback risk — whether AI safety organizations that had received FTX grants or investments might be required to return those funds as part of the bankruptcy estate's asset recovery. <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink> and other recipients faced the prospect of returning pledged funds, threatening financial stability for non-profit and academic AI safety efforts that had come to depend on FTX-sourced capital.[^34]

The episode also prompted broader reflection within EA and AI safety communities about the risks of funding concentration — specifically, the vulnerability of existential risk work to unstable or ethically compromised donors. EA Forum discussions in the aftermath ranged from expressions of shock and calls for donor vetting reform to analyses of whether EA philosophical frameworks had in any way contributed to the conditions enabling the fraud.[^35]

### Community Responses

Reactions within EA-adjacent communities were varied. Some commentators argued that the fraud was the result of individual criminal conduct and organizational failure rather than anything inherent to EA philosophy, and that the broader project of using evidence and reason to prioritize the most important global problems remained sound. Others expressed concern that EA's emphasis on expected-value reasoning and "earning to give" could, in certain interpretations, rationalize ethical shortcuts — and that the community had failed to apply adequate scrutiny to Bankman-Fried precisely because he appeared to be generating large sums for EA causes.[^36]

<EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink>'s Benjamin Todd, in EA Forum discussions, advised that EA organizations should diversify their funding away from the FTX and crypto concentration that had developed.[^37] The episode was widely seen as a significant reputational blow to longtermism and to strong EA frameworks, even if commentators differed on how much it reflected on the underlying philosophy versus the specific actors involved.[^38]

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Fraud and Misappropriation of Customer Funds

The central criticism of FTX concerns the alleged deliberate misuse of customer deposits. According to U.S. prosecutors and evidence presented at trial, FTX lent billions of dollars in customer funds to Alameda Research for trading, real estate purchases, political donations, and venture investments — without any customer disclosure or consent. The top 50 creditors alone were owed approximately \$3.1 billion, and total missing customer funds were estimated at approximately \$8.9 billion.[^39] The scheme has been characterized as a Ponzi-like structure dependent on continuous new deposits to cover Alameda's exposure.

### The FTT Token and Structural Fragility

Academic and institutional analyses have emphasized that FTX's acceptance of FTT — its own token — as collateral created an inherently fragile structure.[^40] The Richmond Federal Reserve's analysis described this as a form of "wrong-way risk": when confidence in FTX declined, FTT's value fell, reducing the collateral value of loans backed by it and accelerating insolvency. A December 2022 SSRN paper identified severe risk and liquidity imbalances between FTX's assets and liabilities as the direct cause of the collapse, and raised broader concerns about the corporate use of privately issued cryptocurrency tokens as collateral.[^41]

### Celebrity Endorsements and Retail Investor Harm

FTX was marketed aggressively to retail investors, including through endorsements by celebrities such as Tom Brady, Shaquille O'Neal, and Naomi Osaka. Class action lawsuits filed against both FTX and celebrity endorsers alleged that the promotion targeted unsophisticated investors without adequate due diligence or disclosure of risks.[^42] Representative Maxine Waters characterized the harm to retail investors — many of whom reportedly lost savings — as among the most serious consequences of the collapse.[^43]

### Bankruptcy Process Objections

Even among creditors who broadly supported FTX's restructuring, objections arose regarding the terms of repayment. The decision to peg cash distributions to cryptocurrency values as of the November 2022 bankruptcy date — when Bitcoin was approximately \$17,000, compared to prices above \$100,000 by late 2024 — was criticized by creditors and their legal representatives as failing to make victims whole in any meaningful economic sense.[^44] Objections were also raised about the lead bankruptcy counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell, on conflict-of-interest grounds, including from bipartisan U.S. senators and creditor attorneys.[^45]

### Wash Trading Allegations

Reports during FTX's operation alleged that the exchange engaged in wash trading — artificially inflating reported trading volumes through coordinated buy-sell activity — to misrepresent its market position to investors and potential customers.[^46]

## Key Uncertainties

Several important questions surrounding FTX remain unresolved or contested:

- **Extent of knowledge among non-executive staff**: It remains unclear how many FTX employees below senior leadership were aware of the customer fund transfers to Alameda. Evidence suggests at least some executives had knowledge, while FTX Future Fund staff have stated they were unaware of the illegality of the funding source.
- **Full asset recovery**: The ultimate amount recovered for creditors through bankruptcy proceedings, and whether distributions will adequately compensate victims given cryptocurrency price appreciation since November 2022, is not yet fully determined.
- **AI safety funding clawbacks**: The extent to which organizations like <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink> and other AI safety grant recipients have been or will be required to return FTX-sourced funds remains a live issue in bankruptcy proceedings.
- **Regulatory implications**: How the FTX collapse will ultimately shape U.S. and international cryptocurrency regulation — including custody requirements, reserve mandates, and exchange-affiliate separation — continues to be debated by lawmakers and regulators.
- **EA community impact**: The long-term effect on EA-aligned organizations' funding strategies, donor vetting practices, and reputational standing within the broader public and policy communities is difficult to assess.
