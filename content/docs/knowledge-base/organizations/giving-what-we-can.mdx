## Overview

<EntityLink id="E863" name="giving-what-we-can">Giving What We Can</EntityLink> (GWWC) is an effective altruism nonprofit that promotes effective giving through education, outreach, and advocacy centered on the **10% Pledge**—a commitment to donate at least 10% of one's income to high-impact charities.[^1] The organization was founded in November 2009 at Oxford University by philosophers Toby Ord and William MacAskill, along with Bernadette Young.[^2] Its mission, as stated by the organization, is to create a world in which giving effectively and significantly is a cultural norm, and ultimately to work toward a world without preventable suffering or existential risk.[^3]

Rather than evaluating individual charities directly, GWWC's research approach focuses on evaluating impact-focused charity evaluators such as GiveWell, Animal Charity Evaluators, and Founders Pledge, and then publishing recommendations across cause areas including global health, animal welfare, and reducing global catastrophic risks.[^1] The organization frames this through the lens of **cause prioritization**: identifying global problems that are pressing, solvable, and neglected.

GWWC grew from 23 founding members in 2009 to more than 10,000 pledgers by 2025, with its community having collectively donated over \$340 million to effective charities.[^4] The organization operated under the umbrella of the <EntityLink id="E517" name="cea">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink> from 2011 until late August 2024, when it became an independent legal entity.[^5]

## History

### Founding

The organization originated from Toby Ord, a philosopher at Balliol College, Oxford, who was inspired by ethicists including Peter Singer. After concluding that his future income could save a substantial number of lives through strategic charitable donation, Ord committed a large proportion of his income to effective charities.[^6] He collaborated with fellow Oxford philosopher William MacAskill and his wife Bernadette Young—then a physician in training—to launch GWWC in November 2009 as an international community encouraging members to pledge at least 10% of their income to cost-effective charities.[^2]

The organization launched with 23 members, a group that included notable figures such as philosopher Peter Singer, development economist Rachel Glennerster, and economist Michael Kremer (later a Nobel laureate).[^2] Within one year, 64 members had joined, collectively pledging approximately \$21 million.[^6]

### Organizational Development

In 2011, the <EntityLink id="E517" name="cea">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink> was incorporated as an umbrella organization for GWWC and <EntityLink id="E510" name="80000-hours">80,000 Hours</EntityLink>, and the term "effective altruism" came into broader use around this time.[^5] GWWC hired its first full-time staff in 2012, having previously been run entirely by volunteers; it also incubated The Life You Can Save, which later spun off as its own organization.[^6]

Membership growth accelerated steadily over the following decade: GWWC surpassed 1,000 members in 2015, reached 5,000 members in 2020, and exceeded 9,000 10%-Pledge signers by December 2024.[^1][^5] In late August 2024, GWWC spun out from CEA to become its own independent legal entity.[^5]

### 2024–2025 Developments

According to GWWC's own reporting, the community donated over \$80 million to charity in 2024, and nearly 900 new individuals took the 10% Pledge that year—a figure the organization characterized as a greater than 50% increase over the approximately 600 new pledgers in 2023.[^7] The organization also published a 2025 strategy announcing an ambitious long-term goal of reaching 1 million pledgers donating \$3 billion annually to high-impact charities.[^8] In August 2025, GiveWell noted GWWC's milestone of reaching 10,000 total 10% pledgers.[^9]

## The Pledges

The **10% Pledge** is GWWC's flagship program, inviting members to commit to donating at least 10% of their income to effective charities for the remainder of their working lives. According to GWWC, the pledge is designed to be flexible—members can donate to any effective charities they choose, and the organization states that the commitment is to consider high-impact giving from income above a modest living standard rather than a rigid annual enforcement mechanism.[^10]

GWWC also promotes three additional pledge variants to encourage broader participation:

- **Trial Pledge**: A shorter-term commitment, typically for one year, allowing people to experience significant giving before making a longer commitment.
- **Company Pledge**: A corporate commitment for organizations wishing to give a portion of revenue or profits to effective charities.
- **Further Pledge**: For those who wish to go beyond 10%, committing a higher percentage of income or wealth.[^1]

The organization also provides donor advising services for high-net-worth donors considering major gifts, connecting them with networks of researchers to guide their philanthropic strategy.[^11]

## Research Approach

GWWC's research team does not independently evaluate individual charities. Instead, it assesses the methodologies and track records of established charity evaluators—such as GiveWell, Animal Charity Evaluators, Longview Philanthropy, and Founders Pledge—and publishes recommendations based on these evaluators' outputs.[^1][^12] This "meta-evaluator" model is intended to help donors navigate an ecosystem of expert evaluators without requiring them to conduct their own due diligence from scratch.

The organization structures its recommendations around three primary cause areas: **global health and wellbeing**, **animal welfare**, and **reducing global catastrophic risks**. Within the last category, GWWC has highlighted AI safety and governance organizations, recommending outfits such as the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence (CHAI) and the Governance of AI (GovAI) as funding opportunities for donors concerned about existential risk from advanced AI systems.[^13][^14]

GWWC has also published educational content drawing on behavioral economics research, including studies examining how presenting cost-effectiveness information affects donor behavior, and experiments linking charitable giving to subjective wellbeing.[^15]

## Role in the Effective Altruism Community

GWWC is widely regarded as one of the founding institutions of the <EntityLink id="E517" name="cea">effective altruism</EntityLink> movement. Its launch in 2009 predates the broader popularization of EA and helped establish the movement's cultural norm of committing a meaningful, defined fraction of income to charity. The organization has collaborated with or incubated several other EA-adjacent organizations, and it maintains partnerships with outfits like Giving Multiplier (a matching fund platform active since November 2020) and the School for Moral Ambition.[^11]

<EntityLink id="E552" name="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> has provided grants to effective giving initiatives (EGIs) in the GWWC ecosystem, and early impact estimates—while difficult to verify independently—suggested leverage ratios that EA-adjacent analysts considered substantial.[^16] An 80,000 Hours analysis from 2015 argued that donating to GWWC could generate a higher return per dollar than donating directly to GiveWell-recommended charities, though such estimates carry significant methodological uncertainty.[^16]

## Criticisms and Limitations

### Pledge Design Critiques

Critics have raised several concerns about the structure of the 10% Pledge itself. One line of criticism focuses on potential **anchoring effects**: by celebrating 10% as the benchmark, GWWC may inadvertently cause some donors to give less than they otherwise would, treating 10% as an adequate ceiling rather than a floor.[^10] A related concern is that pledge recruitment efforts may primarily **accelerate** pledges that would have occurred anyway, rather than creating net-new giving, which would significantly reduce the organization's counterfactual impact.[^10]

The flat 10% structure has also been criticized for failing to account for diminishing marginal utility of income—a progressive or income-scaled giving norm might be more equitable.[^17] Others have noted that the pledge's impact calculations have historically assumed a "perpetual present," summing future donations without appropriate discounting or accounting for shifting cause priorities over time.[^17]

### Intermediary and Overhead Concerns

Some critics question whether GWWC's position as a meta-charity—an intermediary encouraging giving to other charities—provides sufficient value to justify its operational costs. The concern, sometimes called "intermediary drag," is that the overhead of running GWWC may not be offset by the additional giving it generates, particularly given uncertainty about counterfactual impact.[^18]

### Operational Mistakes

GWWC has itself acknowledged several operational shortcomings. In a published account of its mistakes, the organization noted that between 2016 and 2020, it allocated relatively little staff time to running GWWC after merging functions into CEA. Julia Wise, who held primary responsibility for GWWC since 2017, already had full-time community health responsibilities, and technical capacity was spread across multiple projects. This resulted in delayed fixes to technical problems, reduced communications to members, and website functionality that did not meet user expectations.[^19]

The organization also acknowledged that some student groups had run pledge drives that occasionally resulted in people taking the pledge at a young age without adequately thinking through the long-term commitment, and that some communications presented the pledge as something to be taken quickly rather than carefully considered.[^19]

### Broader Philosophical Criticisms

Critics in the EA-adjacent community and beyond have raised broader concerns: that emphasizing giving to global strangers undermines duties to family, local community, or compatriots; that some recommended charities may have unintended negative consequences inadequately disclosed by evaluators; and that "earning to give" frameworks may normalize participation in ethically questionable industries.[^20][^21][^22] GWWC and its supporters have published responses to many of these concerns, but the debates remain active.[^10]

The association of the broader EA movement with Sam Bankman-Fried, sentenced to 25 years in prison, has generated reputational challenges for EA-affiliated organizations including GWWC, though critics and supporters disagree about how much individual misconduct reflects on the underlying philosophical framework.[^20]

## Key Uncertainties

Several aspects of GWWC's impact remain genuinely uncertain:

- **Counterfactual impact**: How much of the giving attributed to GWWC would have occurred anyway through other channels is difficult to measure. GWWC's own 2024 impact evaluation reportedly used a 6x giving multiplier, derived from a substantial internal analysis, but such estimates depend heavily on assumptions about donor counterfactuals.[^7]
- **Pledge attrition**: Data on how many pledgers continue to fulfill their commitments over time, and at what levels, is not comprehensively public.
- **Cause area effectiveness**: GWWC's recommendations span cause areas with very different evidence bases—from the well-studied landscape of global health interventions to the speculative territory of long-term AI risk mitigation—and the relative value of these areas is deeply contested.
- **Anchoring vs. inspiration**: Whether the 10% norm raises or lowers average giving among people who encounter it depends on the population and is an empirical question without a definitive answer.
