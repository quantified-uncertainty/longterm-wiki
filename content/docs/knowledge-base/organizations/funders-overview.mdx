## Overview

Longtermist funders provide critical financial support for organizations working on AI safety, existential risk reduction, and related cause areas. The funding landscape is characterized by a relatively small number of major philanthropists and foundations that provide the majority of resources, with additional support from regranting programs and smaller donors.

The field has experienced significant growth in funding over the past decade, though it remains small relative to overall AI development spending. Major shifts occurred in 2022-2023 with the FTX collapse eliminating a significant planned funding source, though other funders have partially filled the gap.

### AI Safety Funding Concentration

The AI safety funding landscape is highly concentrated among a few donors:

| Funder | AI Safety (Annual) | % of Total AI Safety Funding |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> | \$65M | ≈55% |
| <EntityLink id="sff">Survival and Flourishing Fund</EntityLink> | \$30M | ≈25% |
| <EntityLink id="jaan-tallinn">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink> (direct) | \$10M | ≈8% |
| <EntityLink id="vitalik-buterin-philanthropy">Vitalik Buterin</EntityLink> | \$5-15M | ≈5-10% |
| <EntityLink id="ltff">Long-Term Future Fund</EntityLink> | \$5-10M | ≈5% |
| Other sources | \$5-10M | ≈5% |
| **Total estimated** | **≈\$120-150M/year** | **100%** |

### Untapped Philanthropic Potential

Several major philanthropists have significant resources but minimal AI safety engagement:

| Person | Net Worth | Current AI Safety | Potential (1% of net worth) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| <EntityLink id="elon-musk-philanthropy">Elon Musk</EntityLink> | \$400B | ≈\$0 | \$4B/year |
| Mark Zuckerberg | \$200B | \$0 | \$2B/year |
| Bill Gates | \$130B | Minimal | \$1.3B/year |
| Larry Ellison | \$230B | \$0 | \$2.3B/year |
| Jeff Bezos | \$200B | \$0 | \$2B/year |

If these five individuals allocated just 1% of their net worth annually to AI safety, it would represent **\$11.6B/year** — roughly **80x current total funding**.

### The Scale Gap

| Category | Annual Funding | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **AI Safety (total)** | ≈\$120-150M | Highly concentrated |
| **Gates Foundation alone** | ≈\$7,000M | 50x AI safety total |
| **AI capabilities (industry)** | ≈\$50,000M+ | 400x AI safety total |
| **Global philanthropy** | ≈\$500,000M | 4,000x AI safety total |

## Pending Major Funding Sources

### Anthropic-Derived Capital

<EntityLink id="anthropic-investors">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink> represents potentially the largest future source of longtermist philanthropic capital. At Anthropic's current \$350B valuation:

| Source | Estimated Value | EA Likelihood | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| Founder pledges (7 founders, 80%) | \$39-59B | 2/7 strongly EA-aligned | Only Dario & Daniela have documented EA connections |
| <EntityLink id="jaan-tallinn">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink> stake | \$2-6B (conservative) | Very high | Series A lead investor |
| <EntityLink id="dustin-moskovitz">Dustin Moskovitz</EntityLink> stake | \$3-9B | Certain | \$500M+ already in nonprofit |
| Employee pledges + matching | \$20-40B | High (in DAFs) | Historical 3:1 matching reduced to 1:1 for new hires |
| **Total risk-adjusted** | **\$25-70B** | — | Wide range reflects cause allocation uncertainty |

**Key uncertainties:**
- Only 2/7 founders have documented strong EA connections—71% of founder equity may go to non-EA causes
- Matching program reduced from 3:1 at 50% to 1:1 at 25% for new employees
- IPO timeline: 2026-2027 expected; capital deployment likely 2027-2035

For comparison, this \$25-70B range represents **170-470x current annual AI safety funding** of ≈\$150M. Even if only 10% ultimately reaches EA causes, it would still be transformative.

See <EntityLink id="anthropic-investors">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink> for comprehensive analysis.

### OpenAI Foundation

The <EntityLink id="openai-foundation">OpenAI Foundation</EntityLink> holds 26% of OpenAI, worth approximately \$130B at current valuations. Unlike Anthropic's pledge-based model, the Foundation has direct legal control over these assets. Cause allocation is uncertain—the Foundation's stated mission focuses on "safe AGI" but specific philanthropic priorities are undisclosed.

## Recent Trends

**2024-2026 Developments:**
- Coefficient Giving launched \$40M AI Safety Request for Proposals (January 2025)
- SFF allocated \$34.33M, with 86% going to AI-related projects
- Coefficient Giving (formerly Open Philanthropy) rebranded in November 2025
- LTFF continued steady grantmaking at ≈\$5M annually
- Anthropic founders announced 80% donation pledges (January 2026)
- <EntityLink id="E697">The Foundation Layer</EntityLink> [launched](https://foundation-layer.ai/) (early 2026) — a comprehensive philanthropic guide by Tyler John (Effective Institutions Project) synthesizing five years of AI safety advisory into a donor guidebook, covering alignment, nonproliferation, defensive tech, power distribution, and talent

**Post-FTX Landscape:**
- Future Fund's collapse eliminated ≈\$160M in committed grants
- Some organizations faced funding crises; others found alternative support
- Field-wide diversification of funding sources
