## Overview

<EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>, the AI safety company founded in 2021 by former <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink> researchers <EntityLink id="dario-amodei">Dario Amodei</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="daniela-amodei">Daniela Amodei</EntityLink>, is actively preparing for a potential initial public offering as early as 2026. The company has taken several concrete steps toward going public, including hiring law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati in December 2025—the same firm that managed Google's 2004 and LinkedIn's 2011 IPOs—and conducting preliminary discussions with major investment banks.[^1][^2]

The IPO preparation comes amid extraordinary growth in Anthropic's business metrics. The company's annualized revenue run rate grew from approximately \$1 billion in early 2025 to \$4 billion by mid-2025, representing 300% growth in just seven months.[^3][^4] Anthropic is now guiding toward an annualized run rate of approximately \$26 billion by the end of 2026, driven by its Claude AI models and major enterprise contracts.[^5] This revenue acceleration, combined with a November 2025 funding round that valued the company at <F e="anthropic" f="valuation" />, has positioned Anthropic as a potential candidate for one of the largest technology IPOs in history.[^6]

However, significant uncertainty remains around both timing and execution. While some analysts view a 2026 IPO as feasible, others consider such a quick timeline unlikely without a formal SEC filing.[^7] Prediction markets reflect this ambiguity: Kalshi assigns Anthropic a 72% probability of going public before OpenAI, while Manifold Markets shows a median prediction of June 2027.[^8][^9] The company itself has made no public commitment to an IPO, with Chief Communications Officer Sasha de Marigny stating in late 2025 that there are "no immediate plans" for filing, though the company operates "as if publicly traded."[^10]

## Preparation Status and Timeline

### Current IPO Groundwork

Anthropic's IPO preparation became publicly known in December 2025 when reports emerged that the company had retained Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati for structural and regulatory preparation.[^1] Wilson Sonsini has been an adviser to Anthropic since 2022, but the engagement for IPO-specific work represents a significant escalation.[^11] The firm has a strong track record in technology IPOs, having managed Google's landmark 2004 public offering and LinkedIn's 2011 listing.

Beyond legal preparation, Anthropic has taken several steps commonly associated with pre-IPO companies in 2025:[^2]

- Expanding leadership with executives who have public-company experience
- Enhancing governance frameworks and internal controls
- Attracting large institutional investors including BlackRock, Blackstone, and Fidelity
- Conducting preliminary discussions with investment banks, though no underwriter has been selected

The company has also begun tackling an internal checklist to prepare for what could be one of the largest IPOs ever, according to Financial Times reporting.[^11] However, no official IPO application has been filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as of February 2026.[^12]

### Timeline Estimates and Probability Assessments

The timeline for an Anthropic IPO remains highly uncertain, with estimates ranging from early 2026 to 2027 or beyond. Several factors contribute to this uncertainty:

**Optimistic scenario (2026):** Large investors are reportedly encouraging Anthropic to file ahead of competitors like OpenAI, shifting from a private to public race.[^5] The company's rapid revenue growth and improving unit economics could support an aggressive timeline if market conditions remain stable. Some analysts note that the strong forward revenue multiples of 30-50x for 2026 projections could justify high valuations in public markets.[^5]

**Realistic scenario (2027):** Prediction markets suggest more caution. Manifold Markets shows a median prediction of June 2027 for an Anthropic IPO, reflecting skepticism about near-term execution.[^9] Even with preparation underway, completing the full IPO process—including SEC review, roadshow preparation, and market timing—typically requires significant lead time.

**Probability relative to OpenAI:** Kalshi's prediction market assigns Anthropic a 72% chance of going public before OpenAI, though this percentage depends on trading volume and can change as developments surface.[^8] This suggests market participants view Anthropic as more likely to pursue a near-term IPO than its primary competitor, despite OpenAI's higher valuation of over \$500 billion.

## Financial Trajectory Supporting IPO

### Revenue Growth and Projections

Anthropic's revenue trajectory has been one of the most compelling drivers of IPO speculation. The company has achieved extraordinary growth over a remarkably short period:

| Period | Revenue (ARR) | Growth Rate |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 2022 | \$10M | First full year of operations |
| 2023 | \$100M | 10x year-over-year |
| Early 2024 | \$87M/month | Annualizing to ≈\$1B ARR |
| Early 2025 | ≈\$1B | - |
| Mid-2025 | \$4B | 300% in 7 months |
| August 2025 | \$5B+ | Fastest-growing tech company claim |
| End 2025 (projected) | \$10-12.7B | On track per investors |
| End 2026 (guidance) | \$20-26B | Nearly tripling in one year |

The company launched its Claude AI assistant in March 2023, and revenue growth accelerated dramatically following the release of Claude 3.5 and subsequent versions.[^3][^4] By August 2025, Anthropic claimed to be the fastest-growing technology company, with some reports indicating annualized revenue exceeding \$13 billion.[^13]

Looking forward, Anthropic projects nearly tripling its annualized revenue to approximately \$20-26 billion by the end of 2026.[^5] This exceeds earlier expectations of single-digit billions from just six to nine months prior, reflecting rapid adoption of the latest Claude models and emerging enterprise deals becoming public.

### Customer Base and Enterprise Adoption

Anthropic's customer metrics have grown even more dramatically than revenue:

- **Over 300,000 business customers** as of late 2025 (300x growth from fewer than 1,000 two years earlier)[^3][^14]
- **Large accounts** (>\$100K ARR) increased nearly 7x in the past year[^14]
- **Eight and nine-figure deals** tripled in 2025 compared to all of 2024[^14]
- **Claims to be #1 in enterprise AI market share** per company statements[^15]

Specific customer success metrics demonstrate the value proposition driving adoption:

- **NBIM** (world's largest sovereign wealth fund): ~20% productivity gains, 213,000 hours saved[^15]
- **Novo Nordisk**: Reduced clinical documentation from 10+ weeks to 10 minutes (99.9% time reduction); 50% fewer review cycles[^15]
- **SK Telecom**: 34% improved customer service quality for millions of users[^15]
- **Commonwealth Bank of Australia**: 50% reduction in customer scam losses[^15]
- **Rakuten** (Japan): 79% faster feature development via Claude Code[^15]

### Valuation Progression and Funding

Anthropic's valuation has increased dramatically through successive funding rounds:

| Date | Round | Amount Raised | Post-Money Valuation | Key Investors |
|------|-------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| May 2021 | Series A | \$124.62M | \$674M | Dustin Moskovitz, Eric Schmidt, Jaan Tallinn |
| April 2022 | Series B | \$580M | \$4B | FTX (led) |
| May 2023 | Series C | \$450M | \$4.99B | Google, Salesforce, Zoom |
| Mar 2025 | Series E | \$3.5B | \$61.5B | Lightspeed Venture Partners |
| Sept 2025 | Series F | \$13B | \$183B | ICONIQ, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue |
| Nov 2025 | - | \$15B (committed) | \$350B | Microsoft, Nvidia |

The November 2025 funding round, which brought commitments of \$15 billion from Microsoft and Nvidia, valued Anthropic at <F e="anthropic" f="valuation" />—nearly double the \$183 billion valuation from just two months earlier.[^6][^16] This rapid appreciation reflects both the company's accelerating revenue growth and the broader AI investment boom.

Private market discussions reportedly reference aggressive forward revenue multiples of 30-50x for 2026 projections to justify these high valuations.[^5] While such multiples are elevated by historical standards, they reflect investor belief in Anthropic's potential to capture significant market share in enterprise AI.

### Valuation Scenarios

For comprehensive valuation analysis including bear cases, see <EntityLink id="anthropic-valuation">Anthropic Valuation Analysis</EntityLink>. Summary:

| Scenario | Valuation | Multiple | Probability | Key Drivers |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Bear** | \$175-250B | 0.5-0.7x | 15-20% | Bubble correction, customer churn |
| **Base** | \$350B | 1x | 40-50% | Status quo |
| **Moderate Bull** | \$500-700B | 1.4-2x | 20-30% | Diversified customers, sustained growth |
| **Strong Bull** | \$1-1.75T | 2.9-5x | 5-10% | Market leader, AGI progress |

**Key context**: Anthropic trades at ≈39x revenue vs OpenAI's ≈25x (at \$500B with \$20B ARR). If OpenAI closes its \$100B round at \$830B, both would trade at similar multiples (≈40x). The "undervalued" thesis no longer holds with corrected January 2026 data—see the valuation page for detailed bull and bear case arguments.

### Path to Profitability

Despite extraordinary revenue growth, Anthropic remains unprofitable and capital-intensive. The company is pacing toward approximately \$2.8 billion in net cash burn by the end of 2025.[^17] However, investors and the company project a path to breakeven by 2028—two years ahead of OpenAI's expected profitability timeline.[^5][^17]

The improving unit economics are driven by several factors:

- Increasing revenue per customer as enterprise adoption matures
- Operational leverage as the customer base scales
- Infrastructure investments (including a \$50 billion AI infrastructure expansion) that should support growth without proportional cost increases[^18]

## Competitive Context with OpenAI

### The AI IPO Race

The potential Anthropic IPO is unfolding against the backdrop of a broader AI IPO race, with OpenAI as the most prominent competitor. OpenAI, valued at over \$500 billion in private markets, is also reportedly testing the waters for an IPO and has started preparation, though no listing date has been suggested.[^11][^19]

Several factors differentiate the Anthropic and OpenAI situations:

**Anthropic's advantages:**
- More concrete preparation steps (legal counsel hired, bank discussions underway)
- Higher probability in prediction markets (72% chance of going public first)[^8]
- Faster path to profitability (2028 vs 2030 for OpenAI)[^17]
- Public benefit corporation structure may provide governance advantages

**OpenAI's advantages:**
- Significantly higher valuation (\$500B+ vs \$350B)
- Larger consumer brand recognition via ChatGPT
- More diverse product portfolio
- Stronger revenue base (though growth rate may be slower)

Market analysts note that the race to IPO first could provide strategic advantages. An early public listing would enable fresh capital raising, allow for acquisitions using publicly traded stock as currency, and establish benchmark valuations for the AI model sector.[^18] Whoever goes first will likely influence market expectations and valuation frameworks for subsequent AI IPOs.

### Strategic Positioning and Differentiation

Anthropic has positioned itself distinctly from OpenAI through several strategic choices:

**AI Safety Focus:** Anthropic emphasizes its constitutional AI approach and <EntityLink id="rsp">responsible scaling policy</EntityLink>, distinguishing itself through governance frameworks like the <EntityLink id="long-term-benefit-trust">Long-Term Benefit Trust</EntityLink> presented at the November 2023 AI Safety Summit.[^20] This focus resonates with enterprise customers concerned about AI risks and regulatory compliance.

**Enterprise-First Strategy:** While OpenAI has pursued both consumer and enterprise markets, Anthropic has prioritized enterprise adoption, which is reflected in its customer metrics and business model. The company claims to be #1 in enterprise AI market share and has over 300,000 business customers.[^15]

**Public Benefit Corporation Structure:** Anthropic's legal structure as a public benefit corporation requires the board to balance mission (ensuring "transformative AI helps people and society flourish") alongside shareholder returns.[^21] This structure could provide advantages in navigating regulatory scrutiny and maintaining stakeholder trust through an IPO process.

**Product Differentiation:** Claude models are recognized for coding ability, creativity, and reliability in critical operations.[^22] Specific products like Claude Code, launched in May 2025, achieved over \$500 million in run-rate revenue with 10x usage growth in just three months.[^14]

## Factors Accelerating or Delaying IPO

### Accelerating Factors

Several dynamics could push Anthropic toward an earlier IPO:

**Strong Revenue Momentum:** The revenue trajectory from \$1 billion to \$4 billion ARR in seven months, with guidance toward \$26 billion by end-2026, provides a compelling growth story that public markets typically reward.[^3][^4][^5]

**Investor Pressure:** Large investors are encouraging Anthropic to file ahead of competitors like OpenAI, creating institutional momentum toward a public listing.[^5] These investors may see strategic value in being first to market and establishing valuation benchmarks.

**Capital Requirements:** Anthropic's AI infrastructure expansion plans, including a \$50 billion investment program, require substantial capital.[^18] While the company has secured significant private funding, public markets could provide a larger and more sustainable capital base for long-term investments.

**Competitive Dynamics:** If OpenAI moves toward an IPO, Anthropic may feel pressure to accelerate its own timeline to avoid unfavorable comparisons or being perceived as a follower rather than a leader in the space.

**Market Conditions:** The broader AI investment boom and strong public market appetite for AI exposure could create favorable conditions for a successful IPO, particularly if other technology IPOs perform well in 2026.

### Delaying Factors

Conversely, several factors could slow or postpone an Anthropic IPO:

**Lack of Formal Filing:** As of February 2026, no SEC filing has been submitted, and company leadership has stated there are "no immediate plans" for an IPO.[^10][^12] The formal filing and review process typically requires significant lead time.

**Market Bubble Concerns:** The Bank of England has warned that AI company valuations are "materially stretched," approaching dot-com bubble levels.[^23] A market correction could force Anthropic to delay or reconsider IPO plans.

**Revenue Concentration Risks:** Substantial portions of Anthropic's revenue are tied to specific platforms like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.[^13] This customer concentration could concern public market investors and require diversification before an IPO.

**Profitability Timeline:** With \$2.8 billion in projected net cash burn for 2025 and profitability not expected until 2028, Anthropic would be going public with significant losses.[^17] While many technology companies have done so successfully, it adds complexity to valuation discussions.

**Governance and Regulatory Scrutiny:** As a public benefit corporation with AI safety commitments, Anthropic may face additional scrutiny regarding how it balances mission and shareholder returns. Establishing clear frameworks for this balance before going public could require additional time.

**Alternative Capital Sources:** The company's ability to raise massive private rounds (\$13 billion in September 2025, \$15 billion committed in November 2025) reduces the urgency of an IPO as a capital-raising mechanism.[^16][^6]

## Prediction Market Analysis

### Kalshi Markets

Kalshi, a regulated prediction market platform, offers the most widely cited probability assessment for Anthropic's IPO timing. As of early 2026, the platform shows:[^8]

- **72% probability** that Anthropic will IPO before OpenAI
- This percentage is dependent on trading volume and can change as new information emerges
- The market reflects participant beliefs based on public information and insider speculation

The high probability relative to OpenAI suggests that market participants view Anthropic's preparation steps (legal counsel, bank discussions) as more concrete than OpenAI's reported "testing the waters" activities. However, the 72% figure also implies significant uncertainty—there is still a 28% chance that OpenAI goes public first or that neither company completes an IPO in the near term.

### Manifold Markets

Manifold Markets, a play-money prediction platform that often reflects informed community sentiment, shows a **median prediction of June 2027** for an Anthropic IPO.[^9] This is notably more conservative than the 2026 timeline discussed in some media reports and analyst speculation.

The June 2027 median suggests that prediction market participants expect:
- Significant time required for IPO preparation and regulatory processes
- Potential delays due to market conditions or internal readiness factors
- A more realistic timeline than optimistic media speculation

The divergence between Kalshi's "before OpenAI" betting (which could still be 2026-2027) and Manifold's specific June 2027 median highlights the substantial uncertainty in timing predictions.

## Implications for Effective Altruism Funding

*For comprehensive analysis of founder pledges, employee donations, and cause allocation, see <EntityLink id="anthropic-investors">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink>.*

### Founder Wealth and Pledge Commitments

An Anthropic IPO could have significant implications for funding in the effective altruism (EA) ecosystem. Dario and Daniela Amodei, as primary owners of Anthropic, would see substantial liquidity events if the company goes public at valuations near <F e="anthropic" f="valuation" />.[^24]

While the Amodeis' specific ownership stakes are not publicly disclosed, even modest percentages of such a valuation would represent billions of dollars in potential wealth. This is particularly relevant given:

- Both Dario and Daniela have documented EA connections (Dario was an early Giving What We Can signatory; Daniela is married to <EntityLink id="holden-karnofsky">Holden Karnofsky</EntityLink>, co-founder of GiveWell)
- The founders left OpenAI in 2020-2021 specifically over AI safety concerns, indicating commitment to these issues beyond financial motives[^21]
- Early Anthropic investors included EA-aligned individuals like Jaan Tallinn (founding donor of <EntityLink id="fhi">Future of Humanity Institute</EntityLink>) and Dustin Moskovitz (co-founder of <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>)[^25]
- However, only 2 of 7 co-founders have documented strong EA connections—see <EntityLink id="anthropic-investors">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink> for detailed analysis of cause allocation uncertainty

### Implications for AI Safety Funding

Beyond individual founder wealth, an Anthropic IPO could affect EA funding dynamics in several ways:

**Increased Capital for AI Safety Research:** If Anthropic founders or early employees make significant philanthropic commitments, it could substantially increase available funding for AI safety and alignment research. The scale could be comparable to or exceed current major funders like Open Philanthropy or <EntityLink id="sff">Survival and Flourishing Fund</EntityLink>.

**Influence on Funding Priorities:** New major donors with direct AI development experience could shift funding priorities within EA. They might emphasize different research directions, policy interventions, or organizational strategies based on their firsthand experience building frontier AI systems.

**Competition for Talent:** A publicly traded Anthropic with substantial employee equity programs could compete more effectively for AI safety talent, potentially drawing researchers from nonprofit organizations or academia. This could have mixed effects—concentrating talent at a safety-focused company but reducing diversity of approaches.

**Demonstration Effects:** A successful IPO demonstrating that AI safety can be commercially viable might encourage other safety-focused ventures and change perceptions about the trade-offs between safety and competitiveness.

### Open Philanthropy Considerations

<EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>, a major EA funder, has historically made AI safety a priority area. While Open Philanthropy itself does not appear to have directly invested in Anthropic, co-founder Dustin Moskovitz participated as an individual investor in Anthropic's Series A round.[^25]

An Anthropic IPO could affect Open Philanthropy's strategy:

- Potential increased wealth for Moskovitz (through his personal Anthropic stake) could expand Open Philanthropy's resources
- Success of a safety-focused AI company might validate Open Philanthropy's theory of change around AI governance and safety
- Open Philanthropy might need to reconsider its grantmaking strategy if former grantees or affiliated researchers become wealthy through the IPO

## Criticisms and Concerns

### Valuation and Market Bubble Warnings

The most prominent criticism surrounding Anthropic's potential IPO centers on valuation concerns and broader AI market bubble risks. The Bank of England has specifically warned that AI company valuations, including Anthropic's, are "materially stretched," with valuations approaching dot-com bubble levels.[^23] This raises concerns about the risk of a sharp market correction that could affect IPO timing and success.

Market analysts have noted what one analysis describes as a "pit of speculative fears," with focus shifting from strong fundamentals to hypothetical risks including:[^26]

- AI bubble debates and concerns about unsustainable valuations
- Supply chain disruptions that could affect AI infrastructure
- Geopolitical tensions affecting international operations and markets

The rapid valuation increase from \$183 billion in September 2025 to <F e="anthropic" f="valuation" /> by November 2025—nearly doubling in just two months—particularly exemplifies these bubble concerns.[^16][^6] Critics argue this pace of appreciation is not sustainable and reflects speculative fervor rather than fundamental value creation.

### Revenue Concentration and Business Model Risks

Anthropic faces business model criticisms that could complicate its IPO:

**Customer Concentration:** Substantial portions of Anthropic's revenue are tied to specific platforms like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.[^13] This concentration creates risk if these partnerships change or if competitors gain traction with the same customers.

**Resource-Intensive Operations:** The company is capital-intensive with significant ongoing cash burn (\$2.8 billion projected for 2025).[^17] Many users are non-paying or low-revenue, creating challenges in achieving profitability. These financial pressures could be spotlighted post-IPO, as public companies face quarterly scrutiny.

**Competitive Position:** Despite strong growth, Anthropic faces intense competition from well-funded rivals including OpenAI (valued over \$500 billion), Google's Gemini, and others. The sustainability of current growth rates in such a competitive environment remains uncertain.

### Disclosure and Valuation Uncertainty

As a private company, Anthropic has limited disclosure requirements, creating uncertainty for potential public market investors:[^27]

- **Limited Financial Disclosure:** Private valuations can change rapidly and may not reflect sustainable economics
- **Uncertain Commercialization Timelines:** Path to profitability remains uncertain with breakeven not expected until 2028[^17]
- **Difficulty Assessing Returns:** Without detailed financial statements, evaluating the company's actual performance versus private market valuations is challenging

These factors complicate investor ability to assess Anthropic's true value ahead of a potential public offering and could lead to valuation volatility once detailed financials are disclosed in an S-1 filing.

### Strategic and Governance Questions

**Mission vs. Returns Trade-offs:** As a public benefit corporation, Anthropic is legally required to balance its AI safety mission with shareholder returns.[^21] How this balance will work in practice as a public company, particularly if safety measures constrain revenue growth, remains unclear.

**Timeline Realism:** Some analysts consider an early 2026 IPO unlikely without a formal SEC filing, suggesting that media speculation may be premature.[^7] The gap between reported preparation and actual execution could indicate challenges or delays not yet publicly acknowledged.

**Founder Control:** The ownership structure and voting rights post-IPO have not been disclosed. Questions remain about whether founders will retain sufficient control to maintain Anthropic's safety-focused mission or whether public market pressures could shift priorities.

## Key Uncertainties

Several fundamental uncertainties remain regarding Anthropic's potential IPO:

**Timing:** Will the IPO occur in 2026, 2027, or later? The gap between optimistic 2026 predictions and Manifold's June 2027 median reflects significant uncertainty.[^9]

**Valuation:** Can Anthropic sustain its <F e="anthropic" f="valuation" /> private valuation in public markets, or will public investors demand a discount given profitability concerns and market bubble warnings?[^23]

**Competitive Outcome:** Will Anthropic IPO before OpenAI, and does going first provide strategic advantages or expose the company to being a "test case" for AI model company valuations?

**Revenue Sustainability:** Can the company maintain its extraordinary growth trajectory (tripling revenue in 2026) as the market matures and competition intensifies?[^5]

**Profitability Path:** Will Anthropic achieve its 2028 breakeven target, or will public market scrutiny reveal challenges in the business model that delay profitability?[^17]

**Mission Preservation:** Can Anthropic maintain its AI safety focus and public benefit corporation mission while meeting public market expectations for growth and returns?

**Market Conditions:** Will AI market sentiment remain positive through 2026-2027, or will bubble concerns lead to a correction that makes IPO timing less favorable?

**Regulatory Environment:** How will evolving AI regulation affect Anthropic's business model and attractiveness to public market investors?

These uncertainties suggest that while an Anthropic IPO is increasingly likely, the specific timing, terms, and outcomes remain highly unpredictable. Investors, employees, and observers should expect continued evolution of the situation as the company progresses through preparation stages and market conditions develop.
