title: EA Shareholder Diversification from Anthropic
description: "Analysis of strategies for EA-aligned Anthropic shareholders to reduce portfolio concentration risk. At $380B valuation, an estimated $27-76B in risk-adjusted EA capital is tied to a single illiquid asset, while total annual AI safety funding is only $120-150M. Key strategies include private secondary market sales (Moskovitz precedent: $500M already moved), expanded company buyback programs, pre-IPO DAF transfers, and systematic post-IPO selling plans. Priority: diversifying at least 20% of EA-aligned holdings pre-IPO to reduce single-point-of-failure risk and unlock time-sensitive funding for current AI governance opportunities."

llmSummary: "The EA ecosystem faces extreme portfolio concentration risk with $27-76B in risk-adjusted capital tied to Anthropic stock. This page analyzes diversification strategies across three time horizons: immediate (secondary market sales, expanded buybacks), pre-IPO (DAF transfers, structured share sales), and post-IPO (10b5-1 plans, charitable transfers). Dustin Moskovitz's $500M nonprofit transfer provides the key precedent. An 80% valuation drop would destroy $20-60B in expected EA capital. Priority actions: Moskovitz and Tallinn should expand secondary sales, Anthropic should raise buyback caps, and EA-aligned employees should maximize DAF transfers under current matching terms."

## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **EA capital at risk** | \$27-76B risk-adjusted, tied to single asset |
| **Current AI safety funding** | \$120-150M/year (180-630x smaller) |
| **Diversification urgency** | High — capital illiquid until IPO (est. mid-2027) |
| **Pre-IPO options** | Secondary sales, buybacks, DAF transfers |
| **Key precedent** | Moskovitz moved \$500M to nonprofit vehicle (Nov 2025) |
| **Recommended target** | Diversify at least 20% of EA holdings pre-IPO |
| **Post-IPO options** | 10b5-1 plans, charitable stock transfers, CRTs |
| **Worst-case scenario** | 80% valuation drop destroys \$20-60B in expected EA capital |

## Overview

The effective altruism ecosystem faces an extraordinary concentration risk: an estimated \$27-76B in risk-adjusted EA-aligned capital is tied to a single private company, while total annual EA funding is approximately \$120-150M/year. [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rRBaP7YbXfZibSn3C/front-load-giving-because-of-anthropic-donors) This may represent the largest concentration of *expected future philanthropic capital* in a single illiquid asset in history, and it is almost entirely inaccessible today.

At <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink>'s \$380B valuation (Series G, February 2026), the EA-aligned capital breaks down as follows: [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-30-billion-series-g-funding-380-billion-post-money-valuation)

| Source | Estimated Value | Reliability |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Founder pledges (80% of equity, 7 founders) | \$43-64B gross | Low — only 2/7 have documented EA connections |
| Employee pledges + matching (in DAFs) | \$20-40B | Moderate — legally bound once transferred, but participation rates estimated |
| <EntityLink id="E577">Jaan Tallinn</EntityLink> stake | \$2-6B (conservative) | High — strong AI safety track record |
| <EntityLink id="E436">Dustin Moskovitz</EntityLink> stake | \$3-9B | Very high — \$500M already transferred |
| **Total risk-adjusted** | **\$27-76B** | Discounted from \$68-119B gross for cause allocation probability (only 2/7 founders EA-aligned) and pledge fulfillment risk. See <EntityLink id="E406">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink> for methodology. |

No prudent financial strategy would hold 95%+ of *expected future capital* in a single illiquid position. Yet this is effectively the EA ecosystem's situation with respect to its largest pending funding source.

## The Concentration Problem

### Why This Is Dangerous

**Single-point-of-failure risk.** If Anthropic's valuation drops 80%—comparable to historical tech corrections like WeWork, Snap's 2022 decline, or the 2000 dot-com bust—\$20-60B in expected EA capital evaporates. The remaining \$5-15B would still be significant but represents a fundamentally different philanthropic future than the \$27-76B base case.

<SquiggleEstimate title="EA Capital Loss Under Valuation Decline" code={`
// Current risk-adjusted EA capital
baseCapital = 27e9 to 76e9

// Valuation decline scenarios
decline = mixture(
  0.2 to 0.4,     // mild correction (20-40%)
  0.5 to 0.7,     // moderate correction (50-70%)
  0.8 to 0.95,    // severe correction (80-95%)
  [0.5, 0.35, 0.15]
)

capitalLost = baseCapital * decline
capitalLost
`} />

**Liquidity risk.** All this capital is illiquid until an IPO, which prediction markets place at a median of June 2027. [Manifold Markets](https://manifold.markets/search?q=anthropic%20ipo) If the IPO is delayed to 2029-2030, capital remains locked for 3-4 additional years during a critical window for AI governance.

**Correlation risk.** AI safety funding is concentrated in a company whose value correlates with AI industry conditions. The scenarios where funding is most needed (rapid, uncontrolled AI progress) may coincide with either very high Anthropic valuations (good for capital) or competitive displacement (bad for capital), creating unpredictable dynamics.

**Value drift risk.** Two distinct dynamics erode EA alignment over time. First, *compositional shift*: as <EntityLink id="E406">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink> documents, the fraction of employees with "EA-ish perspectives" is decreasing among newer hires, diluting the EA share of total employee equity. Second, *individual drift*: delayed liquidity means delayed giving, and the longer donors wait, the more likely their cause priorities shift away from current EA priorities.

### Historical Precedents for Concentration Risk

| Event | Lesson |
|-------|--------|
| **FTX collapse (2022)** | \$500M Anthropic stake liquidated for \$1.34B (2.7x), but proceeds went to creditors, not EA. Had FTX survived, that stake would be worth \≈\$27B today. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/ftx-estate-sells-majority-stake-in-startup-anthropic-for-884-million.html) |
| **Facebook IPO (2012)** | Stock dropped \≈50% in first 6 months before recovering. Most employees did not engage in significant philanthropy; Moskovitz was the exception. [Chronicle of Philanthropy](https://philanthropy.com/article/Charities-Seek-Some-of/156577) |
| **Dot-com bust (2000-01)** | Many paper billionaires lost 90%+ of their wealth. Companies like Pets.com went from IPO to liquidation in 268 days. |
| **Giving Pledge fulfillment** | Only 8 of 22 deceased pledgers (36%) met the 50% giving threshold (small sample). Living pledgers' wealth grew 283% while giving lagged. [IPS](https://ips-dc.org/report-giving-pledge-at-15/) |

## Pre-IPO Diversification Strategies

### 1. Private Secondary Market Sales

EA-aligned shareholders can sell Anthropic shares to buyers on private secondary markets. This is the most direct path to diversification before IPO.

**Current market data** (December 2025): [Premier Alternatives](https://www.premieralts.com/companies/anthropic/secondary-market-price)

| Platform | Share Price | Implied Valuation |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Forge Global | \$270 | \≈\$300B |
| Premier Alternatives | \$273 | \≈\$305B |
| Hiive | \$302 | \≈\$340B |
| Notice | \$270 | \≈\$300B |

**Key precedent:** <EntityLink id="E436">Dustin Moskovitz</EntityLink> moved a \$500 million Anthropic stake into a nonprofit vehicle to reinvest returns. [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/11/10/meet-the-millennial-meta-cofounder-and-his-wife-who-are-giving-away-20-billion/) This demonstrates that large EA-aligned holders can and do execute private transactions at scale.

**Constraints:**
- **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)**: Most private company shares require company approval for transfers
- **Volume limitations**: Secondary markets have limited depth; blocks above \$1B are difficult to place without material price impact
- **Discount**: Buyers typically demand 10-25% discounts below last round price for illiquid positions
- **Tax**: Capital gains triggered on sale

**Realistic capacity**: \$500M-\$3B could move through secondary markets pre-IPO without massive discounts.

### 2. Expanded Company Buyback Programs

Anthropic has already conducted one employee buyback. Advocating for expanded programs is a high-leverage intervention.

**March 2025 buyback**: [Maginative](https://www.maginative.com/article/anthropic-launches-first-employee-share-buyback-at-61-5-billion-valuation/)
- Price: \$56.09/share (\$61.5B valuation)
- Eligible: Employees with 2+ years tenure
- Limit: Up to 20% of equity, capped at \$2M per person

**Recommendations for expanded program:**
- Raise the per-person cap from \$2M to \$10M+ for long-tenured employees
- Increase the eligible percentage from 20% to 30-40%
- Offer quarterly buyback windows rather than ad hoc
- Allow transfers to 501(c)(3) organizations as an alternative to cash buyback

### 3. Pre-IPO DAF Transfers

Shareholders can transfer private shares directly to Donor-Advised Funds, which can sell when liquidity becomes available.

**Advantages:**
- Immediate tax deduction at fair market value
- Avoids capital gains tax on appreciated shares (saving \~37% in California) [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rRBaP7YbXfZibSn3C/front-load-giving-because-of-anthropic-donors)
- Legally binding commitment to charitable giving
- Some DAF providers (Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable) accept private company stock

**Scale already achieved:** An estimated \$20-40B is already in DAFs through Anthropic's employee matching program—historically 3:1 at 50% of equity, now reduced to 1:1 at 25% for new hires. See <EntityLink id="E412">Anthropic Pre-IPO DAF Transfers</EntityLink> for detailed analysis, including time-sensitive employee tax considerations (ISOs, AMT, 83(b) elections, QSBS eligibility) that create urgency around the transfer timing.

**Limitation:** DAF donors retain full advisory control over which charities receive grants. Capital in a DAF is legally committed to *some* 501(c)(3), but not necessarily to EA causes.

### 4. Private Placement to EA-Aligned Institutional Buyers

Large EA-aligned foundations or purpose-built investment vehicles could purchase Anthropic shares from existing holders, keeping the capital within the EA ecosystem while providing liquidity.

**Potential buyers:**
- Good Ventures / <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> (Moskovitz's vehicle)
- Purpose-built EA investment vehicles
- <EntityLink id="E542">Longview Philanthropy</EntityLink> or similar advisors facilitating transfers

**Constraints:** ROFR provisions, accredited investor requirements, and concentration risk for the buying institution.

## Post-IPO Diversification Strategies

### 5. Systematic 10b5-1 Selling Plans

Pre-arranged selling plans that execute automatically, compliant with insider trading regulations. Available after the lock-up period (typically 6-12 months post-IPO).

**Best practice:** Sell 5-10% of holdings per quarter, diversifying into a broad market portfolio. This provides certainty of execution regardless of market conditions or psychological biases.

### 6. Direct Charitable Stock Transfers

Transfer large blocks of public stock directly to EA organizations or DAFs. This is the primary mechanism for deploying the bulk of EA-aligned capital.

**Tax advantage:** Avoids capital gains tax on appreciation (potentially saving 20-37% depending on jurisdiction and holding period).

### 7. Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs)

Transfer appreciated shares to a CRT that sells tax-free, invests proceeds, pays income to the donor for life, and transfers the remainder to charity.

**Trade-off:** Provides diversified income stream and tax benefits, but delays full capital deployment to EA causes.

## Priority Framework

### Why At Least 20% Should Be Diversified Pre-IPO

| Argument | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Portfolio theory** | No prudent portfolio should hold \>80% in a single illiquid asset |
| **Historical precedent** | Many tech stocks lose 50-80% from peak; Facebook dropped 50% post-IPO before recovering |
| **Timing risk** | IPO could be delayed 2-4 years beyond current estimates |
| **EA needs are NOW** | AI governance windows, talent pipeline, and research directions may not exist in 3-5 years |
| **Value of information** | Deploying some capital now reveals EA ecosystem absorption capacity |

20% of \$27-76B is approximately \$5-15B. Even achieving the lower end would represent a transformative injection into the EA ecosystem—roughly 33-125x current annual AI safety funding.

### Recommended Actions by Stakeholder

**Tier 1 — Immediate (0-6 months):**

| Stakeholder | Action | Estimated Capital |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Dustin Moskovitz | Expand secondary market sales and nonprofit transfers | \$1-5B additional |
| Jaan Tallinn | Explore secondary market sales for portion of stake | \$500M-2B |
| Large employee stakeholders | Maximize DAF transfers under current matching terms | \$1-3B |
| EA community | Advocate for expanded Anthropic buyback program | Enables above |

**Tier 2 — Pre-IPO (6-18 months):**

| Stakeholder | Action | Estimated Capital |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| EA-aligned shareholders | Coordinate structured diversification | \$2-5B |
| Philanthropic advisors | Establish purpose-built vehicles for share purchases | \$500M-2B |
| All holders | Lock in tax-advantaged DAF/CRT transfers before IPO | \$1-5B |

**Tier 3 — Post-IPO (18-36 months):**

| Stakeholder | Action | Estimated Capital |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| All EA-aligned holders | Set up 10b5-1 systematic selling plans during lock-up | \$5-20B over 3-5 years |
| Founders | Execute large charitable transfers | \$10-40B over 5-15 years |
| Philanthropic ecosystem | Deploy capital to EA causes on 3-10 year horizon | Full remaining |

## Risk Scenarios

### Scenario: Anthropic Valuation Drops 80%

If Anthropic falls from \$380B to \$76B:

| Capital Source | Before (gross) | After (at 20%) | Loss |
|----------------|--------|-------|------|
| Founder equity (80% pledged) | \$43-64B | \$9-13B | \$34-51B |
| EA investor stakes (Tallinn + Moskovitz) | \$5-15B | \$1-3B | \$4-12B |
| Employee pledges + matching | \$20-40B | \$4-8B | \$16-32B |
| **Total (risk-adjusted)** | **\$27-76B** | **\$5-15B** | **\$20-60B** |

Note: "Before" column shows gross figures for rows 1-3; the total applies the same risk-adjustment (cause allocation, pledge fulfillment) as the overview table. See <EntityLink id="E406">Anthropic (Funder)</EntityLink> for methodology.

If 20% had been diversified pre-crash, \$5-15B would be preserved regardless of valuation changes.

### Scenario: Successful Early Diversification (20-30%)

If \$5-15B is diversified pre-IPO:
- Deployed to EA causes 2-3 years earlier than full IPO timeline
- Remaining 70-80% still participates in potential upside
- Funds available for time-sensitive AI governance interventions
- Reduced systemic risk for EA funding ecosystem

### Scenario: Extended IPO Delay (to 2029-2030)

Without pre-IPO diversification:
- 3-4 additional years of total illiquidity
- Missing critical AI governance windows during 2026-2028
- Increased value drift among younger employees
- EA organizations remain resource-constrained during a pivotal period

## Coordination Considerations

### Who Should Coordinate

Several organizations are already positioned to facilitate EA shareholder diversification:

| Organization | Role | Current Activity |
|--------------|------|-----------------|
| <EntityLink id="E542">Longview Philanthropy</EntityLink> | Donor advising for high-net-worth EA donors | \$60M+ advised in 2025; "involves a non-zero amount of advising Anthropic folks" [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H8SqwbLxKkiJur3c4/preparing-for-a-flush-future-work-giving-and-conduct) |
| <EntityLink id="E521">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> | EA grantmaking infrastructure | Manages Moskovitz's philanthropic capital |
| <EntityLink id="E567">Survival and Flourishing Fund</EntityLink> | AI safety regranting | Tallinn-funded; \$34M disbursed in 2025 |

### Risks of Coordination

- **Securities law**: Shareholders "acting in concert" face regulatory scrutiny under SEC rules
- **Information asymmetry**: Coordinated selling by insiders could raise legal concerns
- **Reputational risk**: Perception of "cashing out" before IPO
- **Conflict with Anthropic interests**: Company may prefer shareholders retain stakes for alignment

These risks argue for individual action guided by shared analysis, rather than formal coordination.

## Limitations

**Estimates depend on uncertain inputs.** The \$27-76B range relies on stake estimates, valuation assumptions, and cause allocation predictions that could all be wrong. Only 2 of 7 founders have documented strong EA connections, and 71% of founder equity may go to non-EA causes.

**Secondary market capacity is limited.** Moving \$5-15B through private markets is orders of magnitude beyond normal secondary volume for any single company. Realistic pre-IPO diversification may be limited to \$2-5B.

**Tax and legal complexity.** Each diversification strategy involves significant tax, legal, and regulatory considerations that vary by individual circumstances. Shareholders need qualified professional advice.

**DAF cause allocation is not guaranteed.** Even capital in DAFs—the most "locked in" form—can be directed to any 501(c)(3), not just EA causes.

**This analysis assumes current valuation holds.** If Anthropic's valuation has already peaked, the urgency calculus changes but the argument for diversification strengthens.

## Key Uncertainties

| Uncertainty | Range | Impact |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| IPO timing | 2026-2030+ | Determines when most capital becomes liquid |
| Valuation at IPO | \$100B-\$700B+ | Determines total capital magnitude |
| Secondary market depth | \$500M-\$3B | Limits pre-IPO diversification capacity |
| Founder cause allocation | 30-80% to EA | Determines how much of \$43-64B reaches EA causes |
| Buyback program expansion | Unlikely-Likely | Major lever for early employee liquidity |
| EA ecosystem absorption capacity | \$2-15B/year | Constrains useful deployment rate |
| Regulatory environment | Stable-Restrictive | Could affect secondary sales and IPO timing |
