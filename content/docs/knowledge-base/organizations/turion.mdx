## Quick Assessment

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Type** | AI-focused hedge fund |
| **Parent Company** | Point72 Asset Management (Steve Cohen) |
| **Launched** | October 2024 |
| **AUM** | ≈\$3 billion (as of late 2025) |
| **2025 Returns** | ≈30% |
| **Portfolio Manager** | Eric Sanchez |
| **Focus** | AI hardware, semiconductors |
| **Named After** | Alan Turing, AI pioneer |

## Overview

**Turion** is a dedicated AI stock-picking hedge fund launched by Point72 Asset Management in October 2024. Named after AI pioneer Alan Turing, the fund was seeded with \$150 million of Steve Cohen's personal capital and has since grown to approximately \$3 billion in assets under management.[^1][^2]

The fund represents Point72's first new fund launch in decades, reflecting the firm's conviction in AI as a transformative investment theme. Unlike Point72's core multistrategy fund, Turion operates with more flexibility, allowing longer-biased exposure to the AI hardware cycle.[^3]

## Performance

Turion has delivered strong returns since launch:

| Period | Return | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| October 2024 | 3.5% | Launch month |
| November 2024 | 4.9% | |
| December 2024 | 5.2% | |
| **2024 Total** | **14.2%** | vs. 6.2% Nasdaq |
| October 2025 | ≈9% | Single month |
| **2025 YTD** | **≈30%** | Through late 2025 |

The fund's 2024 performance of 14.2% in just three months significantly outpaced the Nasdaq Composite's 6.2% gain over the same period.[^4]

## Investment Strategy

Turion primarily targets investments in AI hardware and semiconductor companies worldwide. The fund's portfolio is concentrated in companies benefiting from the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout, similar to other AI-focused funds like <EntityLink id="situational-awareness-lp">Situational Awareness LP</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="vara">VARA</EntityLink>.[^5]

The strategy allows for longer-biased positions compared to typical hedge fund approaches, reflecting conviction in the multi-year AI hardware cycle.

## Leadership

**Eric Sanchez** serves as Portfolio Manager for Turion. The fund operates within Point72's broader infrastructure, which manages approximately \$41.5 billion in total assets as of 2026.[^6]

**Steve Cohen**, founder of Point72 and former SAC Capital, personally seeded the fund with \$150 million, demonstrating high conviction in the AI investment thesis.[^2]

## Context: AI Hedge Fund Wave

Turion is part of a broader wave of AI-focused hedge funds launched in 2024-2025:

| Fund | AUM | 2025 Returns | Notes |
|------|-----|--------------|-------|
| Turion (Point72) | ≈\$3B | ≈30% | AI hardware focus |
| <EntityLink id="situational-awareness-lp">Situational Awareness LP</EntityLink> | ≈\$4B | 47% (H1) | <EntityLink id="leopold-aschenbrenner">Leopold Aschenbrenner</EntityLink> |
| <EntityLink id="vara">VARA</EntityLink> | ≈\$8B | 40% (Q3) | Ben Hoskin, EA connections |

These funds share similar investment theses centered on AI infrastructure beneficiaries (NVIDIA, semiconductors, data center power suppliers) but differ in their community connections and specific strategies.

## Key Uncertainties

- **Sustainability of AI hardware cycle**: How long will elevated demand for AI infrastructure continue?
- **Concentration risk**: Heavy exposure to semiconductor sector creates vulnerability to sector-wide corrections
- **Competition**: Multiple large funds pursuing similar strategies may compress returns
- **Point72 integration**: How will Turion evolve as Point72 restructures its equities operations into Point72 Equities and Valist Asset Management?
