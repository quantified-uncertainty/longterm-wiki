## Overview

1Day Sooner is a 501(c)(3) public health nonprofit founded in March 2020 to advocate for human challenge trials as a means to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development. The organization has since expanded into a broader pandemic preparedness and biosecurity policy organization, working across four main areas: human challenge studies, indoor air quality interventions, vaccine development policy (including advance market commitments), and pandemic preparedness advocacy.[^1]

The name "1Day Sooner" reflects the organization's founding thesis: that even getting a vaccine one day sooner could save thousands of lives. By June 2020, volunteers from 162 countries had signed up through the organization to participate in potential COVID-19 challenge trials.[^7]

The organization operates alongside a separately registered 501(c)(4) entity, **1Day Action**, which handles political advocacy work. <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> provided \$1 million to 1Day Action.[^2]

## History

### Founding and COVID-19 Challenge Trial Advocacy (March-December 2020)

1Day Sooner was co-founded by Josh Morrison and Sophie Rose in March 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Morrison, a Harvard Law graduate who had previously founded kidney donation advocacy group Waitlist Zero and the Rikers Debate Project, was thinking of starting an advocacy group for human challenge trials when he came across an unpublished literature review about COVID-19 human challenge studies that Rose, a Stanford biology graduate, had co-authored. He invited her to join the effort.[^7][^8]

The organization quickly attracted public attention and volunteer signups. Coefficient Giving provided initial funding of \$500,000 in May 2020 (via Waitlist Zero) and \$600,000 in November 2020 for general support.[^9][^10]

1Day Sooner's advocacy for COVID-19 challenge trials was met with both support and opposition among scientists and bioethicists. Proponents argued that challenge trials could dramatically accelerate vaccine development, while critics raised concerns about deliberately infecting volunteers with a novel pathogen.[^7]

### UK Challenge Trial Success (2021-2022)

The UK became the first country to authorize a COVID-19 human challenge trial in 2021, partly influenced by 1Day Sooner's advocacy and volunteer organizing. Results from the UK trial were published in February 2022, providing novel insights into COVID-19 infection dynamics.[^11]

### Expansion to Pandemic Preparedness (2022-Present)

Following the initial challenge trial advocacy, 1Day Sooner broadened its mission to encompass pandemic preparedness more generally. Key expansions included:

- **Indoor Air Quality program** led by Gavriel Kleinwaks, focusing on germicidal UV technology
- **Operation Warp Speed 2.0** conferences and white papers on institutionalizing pandemic response capabilities
- **Advance Market Commitments** research and advocacy for pandemic countermeasure development
- **Hepatitis C challenge studies** advocacy and volunteer recruitment
- **1Day Africa** program directed by Zach Kafuko
- **Biosecurity considerations for challenge trials** research published in academic venues[^1][^12]

### FTX Funding and Return (2022-2023)

1Day Sooner received approximately \$400,000 from the FTX Foundation before its 2022 bankruptcy. The organization returned these funds to bankruptcy proceedings by December 2023.[^2]

## Core Programs

### Human Challenge Studies (CHIMs)

1Day Sooner's original and continuing focus is advocating for controlled human infection models (CHIMs) as a tool to accelerate vaccine and therapeutic development. The organization:[^1]

- Recruits and organizes volunteer cohorts for challenge trials
- Partners with academic institutions on challenge trial ethics and methodology
- Sponsored a report with the UK Pandemic Ethics Accelerator on "The Ethics of Controlled Human Infection Model Studies for Mitigating Pandemic Risks"
- Published biosecurity analysis of challenge trial risks in *BMJ Open* (February 2025), examining onward transmission, information hazards, and challenge agent manufacturing risks[^13]

**Hepatitis C Challenge Studies**: A major current priority, with the potential to unlock more than \$10 million in NIH funding for hepatitis C vaccine development. Hundreds of people worldwide have signed up expressing interest in participating. A workshop is planned for 2026.[^14]

### Indoor Air Quality and Germicidal UV

In collaboration with <EntityLink id="rethink-priorities">Rethink Priorities</EntityLink>, 1Day Sooner produced the influential "Air Safety to Combat Global Catastrophic Biorisks" report, which found that mass deployment of indoor air quality interventions (ventilation, filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) could **reduce transmission of a measles-like pathogen by 68%**. This represents approximately one-third of the total effort needed to reduce pathogen transmission by 98%.[^6]

The report identified germicidal UV (GUV) technology, particularly far-UVC, as the most promising intervention because it can achieve considerably higher equivalent air changes per hour by directly inactivating pathogens. Key bottlenecks include lack of clear standards, implementation costs, and regulatory barriers. <EntityLink id="blueprint-biosecurity">Blueprint Biosecurity</EntityLink> works on the same technology from a research and deployment angle.[^6]

#### California SB 1308 Advocacy

In 2024, California SB 1308 proposed banning ozone-emitting air cleaning devices, which as written would have unintentionally encompassed far-UVC technology. 1Day Sooner was the only nonprofit to produce a public statement opposing the bill's impact on GUV research. The organization:[^3]

- Submitted public comments to the Senate committee
- Traveled to Sacramento to meet with Senate staffers
- Presented public comments at the committee hearing
- Collaborated with the Far UVC Coalition on amendments

The campaign highlighted the distinction between existing ozone-emitting electrostatic air cleaners and the emerging generation of germicidal UV technology.[^3]

### Operation Warp Speed 2.0

1Day Sooner has hosted multiple "Operation Warp Speed 2.0" conferences, convening more than 80 health, biosecurity, and research leaders to discuss how to institutionalize the successes of the original Operation Warp Speed for future pandemic response.[^4]

The organization published a white paper with policy recommendations focused on:[^15]
- **Regulatory authorization reform**: Streamlining approval processes for pandemic countermeasures
- **Advance market commitments (AMCs)**: Government guarantees to purchase vaccines/treatments at set prices upon approval, incentivizing private-sector development before pandemics strike
- **Institutional capacity**: Building permanent government infrastructure for rapid medical countermeasure development

The AMC concept is central to 1Day Sooner's pandemic preparedness strategy. An AMC circumvents the market failure problem by guaranteeing a profitable market before a vaccine's development, ensuring that developers' efforts will pay off while keeping prices reasonable.[^15]

### Pandemic Insurance Fund

1Day Sooner campaigns for an internationally administered pandemic insurance fund, composed of donations from wealthier countries, to be deployed in the event of a future pandemic for low- and middle-income countries.[^1]

### Coefficient Giving Funding

Coefficient Giving (now Coefficient Giving) has provided ≈\$4.6M to 1Day Sooner's 501(c)(3) — roughly 36% of cumulative funding — plus \$1M separately to 1Day Action (the 501(c)(4) entity). The \$4.6M Coefficient Giving line in the table above represents the total from OP, which includes these identified grants:[^9][^10][^17]

- \$500,000 for general support (May 2020, via Waitlist Zero)
- \$600,000 for general support (November 2020)
- \$3,000,000 for general support (2023)

### Financial Transparency

1Day Sooner publishes detailed financial information including cumulative funding by donor, IRS Form 990 filings (available for 2020-2023), and explicit disclosure that the organization has **no pharmaceutical company funding** and **no financial stake in studies promoted or therapies involved**.[^2]

## Relationship to AI Safety and the EA Community

1Day Sooner has strong connections to the effective altruism community:

- **Coefficient Giving/Coefficient Giving** is the largest funding source
- **<EntityLink id="rethink-priorities">Rethink Priorities</EntityLink>** collaboration on the air safety report
- **Survival and Flourishing Fund** and **Emergent Ventures** grants
- **EA Forum** presence with regular updates and funding requests
- Josh Morrison has posted on the EA Forum about hepatitis C challenge trial funding opportunities
- Gavriel Kleinwaks has published on the EA Forum about indoor air quality program direction

The organization's work on pandemic preparedness connects to AI safety concerns through the <EntityLink id="misuse-risks">bioweapons misuse</EntityLink> pathway: improved pandemic infrastructure (surveillance, countermeasures, indoor air quality) provides defense-in-depth against both naturally emerging and engineered pathogens, including those potentially enabled by AI.[^6]

## Criticisms and Limitations

### Mission Scope Expansion

1Day Sooner has expanded significantly from its original narrow focus on challenge trial advocacy to a broad pandemic preparedness portfolio. While this diversification addresses important problems, it raises questions about organizational comparative advantage and focus.

### Challenge Trial Impact Debate

The counterfactual impact of 1Day Sooner's COVID-19 challenge trial advocacy is debated. The UK challenge trial proceeded, but conventional vaccine development through Operation Warp Speed delivered vaccines before challenge trials could have meaningfully accelerated the process. The organization's value proposition has shifted accordingly toward future pandemic preparedness.[^7]

### Small Scale Relative to Problem

With ≈\$12.8M in cumulative funding and a small team, 1Day Sooner operates at a scale far below what would be needed to meaningfully address pandemic preparedness infrastructure gaps, particularly for interventions like mass deployment of germicidal UV technology.

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions questions={[
  "Can far-UVC technology achieve regulatory approval and mass deployment before the next pandemic?",
  "Will advance market commitments for pandemic countermeasures gain sufficient political support for implementation?",
  "Is 1Day Sooner's broad pandemic preparedness portfolio more impactful than a narrower focus on challenge trial advocacy?",
  "Can the hepatitis C challenge studies program unlock significant NIH funding for vaccine development?",
  "How does 1Day Sooner's impact compare to other biosecurity organizations like SecureBio or NTI | bio?"
