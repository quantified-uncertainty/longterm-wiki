**Open Philanthropy rebranded to <EntityLink id="E521" /> in November 2025.**

The organization restructured into 13 cause-specific funds open to multiple donors, moving beyond its primary relationship with Good Ventures (Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna's foundation). The name "Coefficient" reflects the goal of multiplying impact through research, grantmaking, and partnerships.

For comprehensive information about:
- AI safety funding (≈\$336M+ since 2014)
- The 2025 Technical AI Safety RFP (\$40M+)
- Grant application processes
