## Overview

The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) is an Oxford-based organization that serves as a central coordinating body for the effective altruism movement. Founded in 2012 by philosophers William MacAskill and <EntityLink id="toby-ord">Toby Ord</EntityLink>, CEA emerged from the need to create an umbrella organization for two earlier projects: Giving What We Can (founded 2009) and <EntityLink id="80000-hours">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> (founded 2011).[^3] The naming process for this new organization was historically significant—it marked the first time the term "effective altruism" was used in its current sense, replacing earlier terms like "optimal philanthropy" and "rational altruism."[^5]

CEA's primary activities center on building and supporting the effective altruism community. The organization runs <EntityLink id="ea-global">EA Global</EntityLink> conferences that bring together people interested in effective altruism ideas, supports over 200 local EA groups across 50 countries,[^34] and builds and moderates the EA Forum—an online discussion platform for the community.[^1] CEA also operates effectivealtruism.org and publishes the Effective Altruism Newsletter.[^6] Through its Community Building Grants Program launched in 2018, CEA provides funding to individuals and groups doing local EA community building.[^7]

The organization has received substantial funding from <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>, including \$26 million for general support in 2022 and \$11 million in June 2023.[^2] CEA currently operates as a project within Effective Ventures, though it announced plans in January 2024 to spin out as an independent organization, with a target date of July 1, 2025.[^35] As part of this spinout, CEA and EA Funds have decided to merge into a single organization that will retain the CEA name.[^35]

## History

### Founding Era (2009-2012)

The roots of CEA trace back to two earlier organizations. <EntityLink id="toby-ord">Toby Ord</EntityLink> founded Giving What We Can in 2009, a community of people pledging to donate a significant portion of their income to effective charities. William MacAskill and others then founded <EntityLink id="80000-hours">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> in 2011, focused on providing career advice for those wanting to make a positive impact.[^3]

In late 2011, members of these two organizations met to discuss creating a new umbrella entity and what it should be named.[^9] This discussion resulted in the adoption of "effective altruism" as the movement's defining term—the first use of the phrase in its current sense.[^5] CEA was formally founded in 2012 with both MacAskill and Ord, philosophers at the University of Oxford, as co-founders.[^10]

During this early period, CEA also incubated projects that later spun off: The Life You Can Save (incubated by Giving What We Can) and Animal Charity Evaluators, originally called Effective Animal Activism (incubated by 80,000 Hours).[^44]

### Consolidation and Growth (2015-2017)

In 2015 and 2016, CEA incorporated several projects including Effective Altruism Global and Giving What We Can, transitioning from a loose umbrella structure to a more centralized organization.[^11] The organization began running its flagship EA Global conferences during this period. The first EA Global in 2015 featured speakers including <EntityLink id="elon-musk">Elon Musk</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="stuart-russell">Stuart Russell</EntityLink>, and Will MacAskill at Google's Mountain View campus, with additional conferences in Oxford and Melbourne.[^45] CEA has acknowledged that the 2015 and 2016 conferences made mistakes by not providing strong animal advocacy content, which made community members focused on animal welfare feel undervalued.[^12]

In 2017, <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> provided \$2.5 million in general support, reflecting growing funder confidence in CEA's work.[^13] CEA also established a Berkeley, California office and launched EA Funds that year.[^46] Sam Bankman-Fried joined CEA as director of development in late 2017, though he worked there only from October to November before leaving to co-found Alameda Research with Tara MacAulay.[^4]

### Expansion and Restructuring (2018-2022)

The Community Building Grants Program launched in 2018, enabling CEA to fund local community builders around the world.[^7] Also in 2018, CEA launched a new version of the EA Forum based on the <EntityLink id="lesswrong">LessWrong</EntityLink> codebase.[^15] The Community Health team, led by Julia Wise (CEA's longest-serving employee, who joined in 2015), was formalized to handle complaints and community concerns.[^47]

In 2020, both Giving What We Can and EA Funds spun out to operate more independently, though they retained operational support from CEA.[^48]

A significant organizational restructuring occurred in September 2022 when the umbrella organization (previously also called "Centre for Effective Altruism") renamed itself to "Effective Ventures Foundation" to reduce confusion. After this change, CEA operates as one project within Effective Ventures, alongside Giving What We Can, <EntityLink id="80000-hours">80,000 Hours</EntityLink>, EA Funds, the Forethought Foundation, the <EntityLink id="govai">Centre for the Governance of AI</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="longview-philanthropy">Longview Philanthropy</EntityLink>, and other initiatives.[^8]

### The FTX Crisis (2022-2024)

The collapse of FTX in November 2022 and Sam Bankman-Fried's subsequent arrest created significant challenges for CEA. The FTX Future Fund had donated \$13.9 million to CEA in 2022—exceeding half of CEA's total historical funding.[^49] Multiple EA leaders, including Will MacAskill, had been warned about SBF's questionable behavior between 2018-2019, though CEA conducted an internal investigation in 2019 and SBF left the board that same year.[^26][^27]

The UK Charity Commission opened a statutory inquiry in December 2022.[^50] Effective Ventures ultimately returned \$26.8 million to the FTX bankruptcy estate—100% of funds received from FTX/FTX Foundation in 2022.[^51] In May 2024, the Charity Commission concluded its inquiry finding no evidence of mismanagement warranting intervention.[^52]

Max Dalton resigned as Executive Director in early 2023 citing mental health challenges. Both Will MacAskill and Nick Beckstead (who had served as CEO of FTX Future Fund) stepped down from Effective Ventures boards.[^53][^54]

### Independence and Merger (2024-Present)

In December 2023, CEA announced that Zach Robinson would become its next CEO, starting in February 2024.[^32] Robinson was selected through a search process that considered hundreds of internal and external candidates. He previously served as Chief of Staff at <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>.

In January 2024, CEA announced plans to spin out of Effective Ventures and become an independent organization.[^35] As part of this process, CEA and EA Funds decided to merge rather than spin out separately, with the combined organization targeting independence by July 1, 2025.[^35] <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> provided \$990,000 in May 2024 to support these spinout costs.[^36]

CEA continues its core activities, including EA Global conferences—with EA Global: Boston 2024 held November 1-3 at the Hynes Convention Center[^19] and plans for EA Global: Bay Area (February 21-23, 2025) and EA Global: London (June 6-8, 2025).[^20]

## Programs and Activities

CEA operates several interconnected programs focused on community building and knowledge sharing.

**EA Global Conferences** are CEA's flagship activity, bringing together people interested in effective altruism to share ideas, network, and collaborate.[^1] These multi-day events take place in major cities including Boston, London, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The 2025 schedule includes EA Global: Bay Area in February at the Oakland Marriott and EA Global: London in June at the Intercontinental London.[^20]

**Community Building Grants**, started in 2018, provide full- and part-time grants to individuals and groups doing local effective altruism community building.[^7] The program has supported groups at universities and in cities around the world, helping grow the network to over 200 groups across 50 countries.[^34]

**The EA Forum** serves as an online discussion platform for the effective altruism community.[^1] Built as a fork of the <EntityLink id="lesswrong">LessWrong</EntityLink> codebase in 2018, most code development is done by the LessWrong team and then ported to the EA Forum.[^15]

**Virtual Programs**, launched in Q1 2021 by CEA contractor Emma Abele, attracted over 600 participants and 100 facilitators in their first iteration.[^16] The EA Introduction Fellowship is an 8-week program with weekly readings and discussion groups of 4-8 people, moderated by experienced community members.[^21]

## Funding

CEA receives substantial support from <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>, which has provided tens of millions of dollars in grants over the years. As of March 2024, the organization has a budget of approximately \$30 million.[^33]

| Year | Amount | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 2017 | \$2,500,000 | General support[^13] |
| 2021 | \$7,500,000 | General support[^22] |
| 2022 | \$26,000,000 | General support[^2] |
| June 2023 | \$11,000,000 | Support CEA[^2] |
| November 2023 | \$3,406,887 | General support[^23] |
| May 2024 | \$990,000 | Spinout costs[^36] |

Open Philanthropy has also provided targeted grants including \$7,783,000 over two years for EA Funds regranting support, \$5,318,000 over three years for a biosecurity coworking space in Boston, and \$500,000 for EA Infrastructure Fund support.[^24]

## Organizational Structure

CEA operates through the Effective Ventures legal structure, which consists of two separate entities: Effective Ventures Foundation (UK), a registered charity in England and Wales (charity number 1149828) and a Netherlands registered tax-deductible entity (ANBI 825776867); and Effective Ventures Foundation USA, a section 501(c)(3) organization (EIN: 47-1988398).[^37][^38]

As of March 2024, CEA has approximately 40 staff members.[^33] Following the planned merger with EA Funds and spinout from Effective Ventures, the organization expects to operate independently by July 2025.[^35]

## Criticisms and Controversies

### The FTX Connection

CEA's most significant controversy stems from its connections to Sam Bankman-Fried. He met co-founder William MacAskill in 2013,[^25] joined CEA as director of development in late 2017 (serving from October to November), and then left to co-found Alameda Research with CEA staff member Tara Hedley (née Mac Aulay).[^4] Bankman-Fried served on CEA's board until 2019.[^26]

William MacAskill was personally cautioned about Bankman-Fried by at least three different people in 2018 and 2019.[^27] Issues reported to EA leaders about Alameda beginning in 2018 included "pervasive dishonesty, sloppy accounting, and rejection of corporate controls"—problems that presaged the FTX scandal four years later.[^28] CEA conducted an internal investigation relating to CEA and Alameda sometime in 2019, and Bankman-Fried left the board that same year.[^26]

Following FTX's collapse and Bankman-Fried's arrest in November 2022,[^18] questions arose about whether CEA and the broader EA movement exercised adequate oversight and judgment regarding someone who became one of the movement's most prominent figures and funders.

### Philosophical Critiques

As a central institution of effective altruism, CEA faces criticism of the movement's approach more broadly. Critics argue that EA's data-centric approach marginalizes principles that don't lend themselves to quantification—justice, fairness, and equality.[^29] Some have argued that EA excludes perspectives from feminist theory, critical disability studies, critical race theory, and anti-colonial theory.[^29] Environmental ethicists have noted tensions with EA's focus on entities that can suffer, which conflicts with frameworks that value ecosystems and non-sentient nature.[^30]

### Organizational Focus Concerns

Some in the EA community have raised concerns about whether CEA remains aligned with core effective altruism principles. An EA Forum post titled "Centre for Effective Altruism Is No Longer 'Effective Altruism'-Related" represents these internal community concerns about organizational direction.[^31]

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions questions={[
  "How will the CEA-EA Funds merger and spinout from Effective Ventures affect organizational strategy and priorities?",
  "What governance changes will accompany the transition to an independent organization?",
  "How effective are Community Building Grants at producing lasting engagement versus temporary interest?",
  "What is the organization's funding diversity beyond Open Philanthropy?"
