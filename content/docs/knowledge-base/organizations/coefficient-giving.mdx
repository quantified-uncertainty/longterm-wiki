## Overview

[Coefficient Giving](https://coefficientgiving.org/) is a major philanthropic organization that has directed over \$4 billion in grants since 2014 across global health, AI safety, pandemic preparedness, farm animal welfare, and other cause areas. In November 2025, the organization [rebranded from Open Philanthropy to Coefficient Giving](https://coefficientgiving.org/research/open-philanthropy-is-now-coefficient-giving/), signaling an expansion from serving primarily one anchor donor (Good Ventures, the foundation of Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna) to operating 13 cause-specific funds open to multiple philanthropists. The name "Coefficient" reflects the organization's goal of multiplying impact through research, grantmaking, and partnerships—with "co" nodding to collaboration and "efficient" reflecting their unusual focus on cost-effectiveness.

Coefficient Giving is widely considered the largest funder of AI safety work globally. Since 2014, approximately \$336 million (12% of total grants) has gone to AI safety research and governance, with roughly \$46 million deployed in 2023 alone—making it the dominant external funder in a field where most safety research happens inside frontier AI labs. The organization's [Navigating Transformative AI Fund](https://coefficientgiving.org/funds/navigating-transformative-ai/) supports <EntityLink id="technical-research">technical AI safety research</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="governance-policy">AI governance and policy</EntityLink> work, and capacity building, with a [\$40 million Technical AI Safety RFP](https://coefficientgiving.org/funds/navigating-transformative-ai/request-for-proposals-technical-ai-safety-research/) launched in 2025 covering 21 research areas.

The organization distinguishes itself through its strategic cause selection methodology—identifying problems that are large, tractable, and neglected relative to their size. This approach, combined with a willingness to fund speculative research and support multiple funding mechanisms (direct grants, regranting programs, pooled funds), has made Coefficient Giving central to the effective altruism funding ecosystem. However, critics have noted concerns about funding concentration, the slow pace of spending relative to the scale of AI risks, and heavy focus on evaluations over alignment research in recent <EntityLink id="technical-ai-safety">technical AI safety</EntityLink> grants.

## History and Evolution

### Origins (2011-2017)

Coefficient Giving traces its origins to 2011 when GiveWell, the charity evaluator founded by Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld, began advising Good Ventures on how to deploy Dustin Moskovitz's philanthropic capital effectively. Good Ventures was established by Moskovitz (Facebook co-founder, net worth ≈\$12 billion) and Cari Tuna in 2011. By 2014, this advising relationship formalized into "Open Philanthropy" as a distinct project within GiveWell, focused on identifying high-impact giving opportunities across a broader range of cause areas than GiveWell's traditional global health focus.

In 2017, Open Philanthropy [spun off from GiveWell](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/open-philanthropy-is-now-an-independent-organization/) as an independent LLC, enabling it to pursue its own strategic priorities while GiveWell continued focusing on evidence-backed global health interventions. The separation reflected diverging methodologies: GiveWell prioritizes robust evidence of effectiveness, while Open Philanthropy embraced "hits-based giving"—funding speculative, high-variance projects where a few major successes could justify many failures.

### Growth and AI Safety Focus (2015-2024)

Open Philanthropy began supporting AI safety work in 2015, when the field was nascent and institutional support was minimal. Early grants helped establish foundational organizations including the [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/machine-intelligence-research-institute-ai-safety-retraining-program/) (<EntityLink id="miri">MIRI</EntityLink>), the [Center for Human-Compatible AI](https://humancompatible.ai/) at UC Berkeley, and the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford. By 2023, AI safety had become Open Philanthropy's largest longtermist cause area, reflecting growing concern about advanced AI risks among the leadership team.

| Year | AI Safety Milestone |
|------|-------------------|
| 2015 | First AI safety grants; field had ≈10 full-time researchers |
| 2017 | Independent organization; Holden Karnofsky publishes AI concerns |
| 2019 | AI safety spending exceeds \$20M annually |
| 2022 | \$150M Regranting Challenge launched (not AI-specific) |
| 2023 | ≈\$46M AI safety spending; largest funder in the field |
| 2024 | ≈\$50M committed; 68% to evaluations/benchmarking |
| 2025 | Rebrand to Coefficient Giving; \$40M Technical AI Safety RFP |

### The November 2025 Rebrand

On November 18, 2025, Open Philanthropy [announced its rebranding to Coefficient Giving](https://coefficientgiving.org/research/open-philanthropy-is-now-coefficient-giving/). The change reflected several strategic shifts:

**Multi-Donor Expansion**: The organization moved from primarily serving Good Ventures to operating pooled funds open to any philanthropist. In 2024, Coefficient directed over \$100 million from donors besides Good Ventures; by 2025, non-Good Ventures funding had more than doubled.

**Brand Clarity**: The "Open Philanthropy" name created confusion—journalists mistook them for <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>, potential grantees confused them with Open Society Foundations. "Coefficient" provided a distinctive identity.

**Structural Reorganization**: The organization restructured from program areas to 13 distinct funds, each with dedicated leadership and transparent goals, allowing donors to support specific causes at scale.

`} />

### Long-Term Future Fund (LTFF)

The [Long-Term Future Fund](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future) is a committee-based grantmaking fund that receives significant support from Coefficient. About half of LTFF funding historically comes from Open Philanthropy donations.

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Annual Volume** | ≈\$6.7M (2023) |
| **AI Safety Portion** | ≈\$4.3M (≈65% of grants) |
| **Grant Count** | ≈200 grants per year |
| **Median Grant** | ≈\$15-30K |
| **Decision Model** | Committee of fund managers |
| **Transparency** | High (public grant reports) |

LTFF grants tend toward smaller, faster decisions than direct Coefficient grants, serving researchers and projects that may not yet warrant Coefficient's full evaluation process.

### Manifund AI Safety Regranting

[Manifund](https://manifund.org/about/regranting) operates a distinct regranting model where individual experts receive budgets to make independent funding decisions. For 2025, Manifund raised \$2.25 million and announced their first 10 regrantors.

**Named 2025 Regrantors**:

| Regrantor | Budget | Background | Focus |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Evan Hubinger** | \$450K | Anthropic AGI Safety Researcher, former LTFF manager | Technical AI safety |
| **Ryan Kidd** | ≈\$100K+ | Co-director of SERI MATS | Emerging talent |
| **Marius Hobbhahn** | ≈\$100K+ | CEO of Apollo Research | Evaluations, scheming |
| **Lisa Thiergart** | ≈\$100K+ | Director at SL5 Task Force, former MIRI | Governance |
| **Gavin Leech** | ≈\$100K+ | Cofounder Arb Research | Research reviews |
| **Dan Hendrycks** | ≈\$100K+ | Director of CAIS | Safety research |
| **Adam Gleave** | ≈\$100K+ | CEO of FAR AI | Adversarial robustness |

**Manifund Regranting Characteristics**:

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Speed** | Grant to bank account in under 1 week |
| **Typical Grant Size** | \$5K-\$50K |
| **Decision Authority** | Solo regrantor decisions |
| **Oversight** | Manifund reviews but doesn't approve |
| **Risk Tolerance** | High (encourages speculative grants) |

**Notable Manifund Grants**:

| Project | Amount | Regrantors | Impact |
|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Timaeus (DevInterp) | \$143,200 | Evan Hubinger, Rachel Weinberg, Marcus Abramovitch, Ryan Kidd | First funding; accelerated research months |
| ChinaTalk | \$37,000 | Joel Becker, Evan Hubinger | Coverage of China/AI, including DeepSeek |
| Shallow Review 2024 | \$9,000 | Neel Nanda, Ryan Kidd | Induced further \$5K from OpenPhil |

### Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF)

The [Survival and Flourishing Fund](https://survivalandflourishing.fund/) uses a unique "S-process" algorithm for grant allocation, primarily funded by Jaan Tallinn (Skype co-founder). While Coefficient and SFF are independent, they share many grantees and strategic priorities.

| Aspect | Coefficient | SFF |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **2024 Volume** | ≈\$650M total | ≈\$24M |
| **AI Safety %** | ≈12% | ≈86% (\$20M) |
| **Decision Model** | Staff + regrantors | S-process algorithm |
| **Speed** | Rolling | Twice yearly rounds |
| **Overlap** | High | High |

## How to Apply for Funding

### Direct Application to Coefficient

The most straightforward path for substantial funding requests:

| Step | Details | Timeline |
|------|---------|----------|
| **1. Check RFPs** | Review active [Requests for Proposals](https://coefficientgiving.org/apply-for-funding/) | Ongoing |
| **2. Submit EOI** | 300-word expression of interest describing project | N/A |
| **3. Initial Response** | Coefficient responds with interest level | 2 weeks |
| **4. Full Proposal** | If invited, submit detailed proposal with budget | 2-4 weeks to prepare |
| **5. Due Diligence** | Coefficient evaluates organization and proposal | 4-8 weeks |
| **6. Decision** | Grant approval or rejection | Total: 2-4 months |

**Tips for Applicants** (from Coefficient's guidance):

The bar is intentionally low for submitting expressions of interest. Key failure modes to avoid include not demonstrating understanding of prior work (read papers linked in relevant RFP sections) and not demonstrating that your team has prior experience with ML projects. Even uncertain proposals are worth submitting as the RFP is partly an experiment to understand funding demand.

### Via Regranting Platforms

Faster and more accessible for smaller grants:

| Platform | Best For | How to Apply |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Manifund** | \$5-50K projects, emerging researchers | Create project on [manifund.org](https://manifund.org), contact regrantors directly |
| **LTFF** | \$10-100K, established track record | Apply via [EA Funds](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future) |
| **SFF** | \$100K+, established organizations | Apply during [S-process rounds](https://survivalandflourishing.fund/) |

### Finding Regrantors

Many regrantors are reachable through:

- **Direct outreach**: Email or social media (many are publicly active on Twitter/X, LessWrong)
- **EA communities**: EA Forum, Alignment Forum, local EA groups
- **Professional networks**: AI safety conferences (NeurIPS safety track, ICML), SERI MATS alumni
- **Manifund platform**: Create project and regrantors may proactively reach out

## Comparison with Other AI Safety Funders

| Aspect | Coefficient Giving | LTFF | SFF | Manifund |
|--------|-------------------|------|-----|----------|
| **2024 AI Safety Volume** | ≈\$50M | ≈\$4.3M | ≈\$20M | ≈\$2M |
| **Total Assets** | Good Ventures (\$12B+) | Pool of donors | Jaan Tallinn | Donors |
| **Decision Model** | Staff + regrantors | Committee | S-process algorithm | Individual regrantors |
| **Typical Grant Size** | \$100K-\$5M | \$15-100K | \$100K-\$2M | \$5-50K |
| **Speed (EOI to decision)** | 2-4 months | 1-3 months | 6 months (rounds) | Under 2 weeks |
| **Transparency** | Medium (public database) | High (detailed reports) | High (S-process public) | Very high (live on platform) |
| **Risk Tolerance** | Medium | Medium-High | Medium | High |
| **Best For** | Major grants, established orgs | Growing researchers | Established orgs | Early-stage, speculative |

### Funding Gap Analysis

According to an [overview of AI safety funding](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WGpFFJo2uFe5ssgEb/an-overview-of-the-ai-safety-funding-situation), total external philanthropic AI safety funding (≈\$100M annually) is dwarfed by:

| Comparison | Amount | Ratio to Safety Funding |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| **Generative AI Investment (2023)** | ≈\$24B | 240:1 |
| **Frontier Lab Safety Budgets** | ≈\$500M+ combined | 5:1 |
| **US Government AI R&D** | ≈\$3B annually | 30:1 |

This funding gap is a persistent concern in the AI safety community, though Coefficient and other funders argue that talent constraints, not funding, are often the binding limitation.

## Critical Assessment

### Strengths

**Scale and Stability**: With Good Ventures' multi-billion dollar backing, Coefficient can make commitments that smaller funders cannot. This enables multi-year organizational support, compute grants, and substantial research programs.

**Strategic Sophistication**: The organization's cause selection methodology and research depth (public writeups, shallow investigations, deep dives) provides unusually transparent reasoning for grant decisions.

**Ecosystem Building**: By funding LTFF, Manifund, and other regranting mechanisms, Coefficient amplifies its reach while maintaining quality through trusted intermediaries.

**Hits-Based Giving**: Willingness to fund speculative research acknowledges that transformative progress often comes from unexpected directions, though this increases variance in outcomes.

### Limitations and Criticisms

**Funding Concentration**: With Coefficient representing ~60% of external AI safety funding, the field is heavily dependent on one organization's worldview and priorities. Critics note this could lead to "possible solutions being overlooked or assumptions no longer being questioned."

**Evaluation Focus**: The heavy focus on evaluations/benchmarking (68% of 2024 technical grants) has drawn criticism. As one researcher noted, "This looks much worse than I thought it would, both in terms of funding underdeployment, and in terms of overfocusing on evals." Critics argue AI Safety Institutes are already well-resourced for evaluation work.

**Alignment Neglect**: Some researchers express disappointment that "there's so little emphasis in this RFP about alignment, i.e. research on how to build an AI system that is doing what its developer intended it to do."

**Slow Spending**: Coefficient has [acknowledged](https://coefficientgiving.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/) that "in retrospect, our rate of spending was too slow, and we should have been more aggressively expanding support for technical AI safety work earlier." Key reasons cited include difficulty making qualified senior hires and disappointment with returns to past spending.

**Grants Database Limitations**: The public grants database "offers an increasingly inaccurate picture" of Coefficient's work, as it generally excludes funding advised from non-Good Ventures donors. Coefficient is considering deprecating it.

### Strategic Questions

| Question | Context |
|----------|---------|
| **Funding deployment rate** | Is \$50M/year appropriate given AI development pace? |
| **Evaluation vs alignment balance** | Should more funding go to core alignment research? |
| **Lab relationships** | How to maintain independence while funding lab-adjacent work? |
| **Multi-donor model** | Will expanding beyond Good Ventures change priorities? |
| **Talent vs funding constraint** | Is the field truly talent-constrained, or is this justifying underspending? |
