## Overview

The International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS) is an independent Swiss non-profit foundation launched in February 2024 to strengthen international biosecurity governance amid rapid advances in bioscience and biotechnology.[^2] The organization was incubated by <EntityLink id="nti-bio">NTI | bio</EntityLink> (the biosecurity division of the Nuclear Threat Initiative) beginning in 2019, with its need identified through consultations with international stakeholders who recognized a critical gap in the global architecture for responsible stewardship of science.[^7]

IBBIS is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, at Route de Frontenex 41A, and is registered as a Swiss foundation with public-good mission (UID CHE-182.748.080).[^2] The organization's vision is "a world in which bioscience and biotechnology can advance and flourish safely and responsibly," and its initial focus centers on preventing the misuse of DNA synthesis technology through practical tools and international standards.[^8]

The organization's flagship product is the **Common Mechanism** (software package name: **commec**), a free, open-source, globally available tool for screening orders of synthetic DNA and RNA.[^1] Unlike proprietary alternatives, commec runs locally on provider systems with no data transferred to IBBIS, protecting customers' intellectual property while enabling compliance with biosecurity standards.[^9]

Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, former FDA Commissioner, has described IBBIS as "a necessary institution" that "fills a critical gap in the global architecture for responsible stewardship of science."[^2]

## History

### Origins at NTI | bio (2019-2023)

In 2019, NTI \| bio and international stakeholders identified the need for a dedicated organization to reduce emerging biological risks from advancing biotechnology.[^7] This work emerged from NTI's Biosecurity Innovation and Risk Reduction Initiative (BIRRI). NTI launched the International Technical Consortium for DNA Synthesis Screening in partnership with the World Economic Forum in 2019, which began developing technical specifications for synthesis screening in 2020.[^10]

In Fall 2022, NTI appointed Dr. Piers Millett as the inaugural Executive Director of the organization-in-formation.[^11] Throughout 2021-2023, initial databases and screening algorithms were developed for what would become the Common Mechanism.[^1]

### Launch and Early Operations (2024)

- **February 2024**: IBBIS officially launched as an independent organization[^2]
- **May 2024**: Common Mechanism v0.1 (commec software) released at SynBioBeta[^1]
- **June 2024**: Accepted as a registered Swiss non-profit foundation[^2]

### Expansion and Standards Work (2025)

- **February 2025**: IBBIS participated in the AI Action Summit in Paris, contributing to discussions on AI and life sciences biosecurity[^12]
- **October 2025**: Sequence Biosecurity Risk Consortium (SBRC) launched at the iGEM Responsibility Conference in Paris, defining what counts as a "sequence of concern"[^13]
- **November 2025**: DNA Screening Standards Consortium (DSSC) launched in Singapore on November 6, with ≈30 experts from industry, academia, and government[^14]
- **2025**: IBBIS submitted formal response to the European Commission's call for evidence on the EU Biotech Act, advocating for mandatory synthesis screening provisions[^6]
- **2025**: Paris Peace Forum Scale Up Program selected IBBIS as one of 10 initiatives for accelerated support[^5]

## Core Programs

### Common Mechanism (commec)

The Common Mechanism is IBBIS's flagship product: a free, open-source software package for screening orders of synthetic DNA and RNA.[^1] It addresses two critical biosecurity functions: identifying potentially dangerous sequences (toxins, pathogen genes) and supporting customer verification.

**Key features:**

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Cost** | Free and open-source (GitHub: ibbis-bio/common-mechanism)[^15] |
| **Privacy** | Runs locally; no data transferred from users to IBBIS[^9] |
| **Screening steps** | Biorisk search (HMM-based), Taxonomy search (regulated pathogens), Low-concern clearing[^1] |
| **Performance** | Exceeds Bronze Standard benchmarks; tested against real customer orders[^16] |
| **Version** | v0.1 released May 2024; ongoing development[^1] |
| **Contact** | screening@ibbis.bio[^9] |

The software differentiates itself from proprietary alternatives by being fully open-source with publicly available databases, enabling any provider regardless of size or location to implement biosecurity screening at no cost.[^9]

### International Screening Standards

IBBIS works to harmonize and standardize DNA synthesis screening approaches globally, with core efforts including:[^17]

- Strengthening screening standards (particularly operationalizing ISO 20688-2:2024)
- Promoting universal adoption across providers of all sizes
- Strengthening international coordination across US, UK, EU, WHO, and ASEAN frameworks

### DNA Screening Standards Consortium (DSSC)

Launched November 6, 2025, in Singapore, the DSSC unites approximately 30 experts from industry, academia, government, standards bodies, and civil society to deliver practical screening guidance.[^14]

**Key deliverables:**
- Clarify and operationalize ISO 20688-2:2024 biosecurity provisions through a supplementary implementation guide
- Develop ready-to-use workflows, templates, and training tools
- Facilitate global alignment across industry, regulators, and international organizations

The DSSC works alongside the **Sequence Biosecurity Risk Consortium (SBRC)**, which defines what counts as a sequence of concern, while the DSSC translates those definitions into practical implementation standards.[^13][^14]

Sophie Peresson, IBBIS Technical Lead, stated: "The world doesn't need another statement of intent -- it needs instructions that work. This Consortium is the engine that will convert standards into simple, consistent workflows."[^14]

### Global DNA Synthesis Map

An interactive online tool showing, for the first time at a global level, where synthesis providers are located, how they screen orders, and what policies apply.[^18] The mapping identified providers across Africa, Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the MENA region, and catalogued relevant policies in over 60 countries.[^18]

A key finding from this mapping: only **15% of synthetic DNA providers** currently implement screening for sequences of concern, representing a major regulatory and security gap.[^6]

### Biosecurity Game Changers Fellowship

IBBIS partners with the Brown University Pandemic Center, CEPI, Gavi, Pandemic Action Network, and the BWC Implementation Support Unit to host fellows from the Global South for a year-long biosecurity leadership program.[^19] The fellowship targets early- to mid-career biosecurity professionals, with an inaugural class of eight fellows beginning in 2024.

## Policy and Advocacy

### EU Biotech Act

IBBIS submitted a formal response to the European Commission's call for evidence, advocating for a phased pathway built around four pillars:[^6]

1. Strengthening internationally recognized standards (ISO 20688-2)
2. Promoting universal adoption by linking compliance to licensing and EU research funding
3. Enhancing international coordination with US, UK, WHO, and ASEAN frameworks
4. Phasing in enforceable and auditable screening standards across the EU single market

The submission was endorsed by the International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC), European Synthetic Biology Society, Pandemic Action Network, and Pour Demain Belgium.[^6] IBBIS co-hosted a high-level roundtable at the European Parliament on biosecurity in the bioeconomy.[^20]

### AI and Biosecurity

IBBIS participated in the February 2025 AI Action Summit in Paris, contributing to discussions on biosecurity implications of advancing AI capabilities for biological research.[^12] This aligns with broader concerns about AI-enabled biological threats -- see <EntityLink id="securebio">SecureBio</EntityLink> for complementary work on AI capability evaluations.

## Funding

| Source | Amount | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| [Founders Pledge](https://www.founderspledge.com/) | \$3,000,000 | Launch funding for first three years of operations[^3] |
| Paris Peace Forum | Programmatic support | Scale Up Program mentorship and strategy guidance[^5] |

Founders Pledge recommended unrestricted funding to IBBIS, citing the organization's institutional pedigree (NTI \| bio incubation) and leadership credibility (Millett's BWC and FHI experience) as key factors supporting their confidence.[^3]

## Relationship to NTI | bio

IBBIS was incubated by NTI \| bio, the biosecurity division of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, following a classic incubation-to-spinout model:[^7]

1. **2019**: NTI \| bio and stakeholders identified the need for a dedicated biosecurity organization
2. **2019**: NTI launched the International Technical Consortium for DNA Synthesis Screening with the World Economic Forum
3. **2020-2023**: NTI \| bio incubated IBBIS, developing tools and building the team
4. **2022**: Piers Millett appointed as Executive Director
5. **2024**: IBBIS launched as a fully independent Swiss foundation

IBBIS is now organizationally independent from NTI, though the relationship reflects NTI \| bio's broader biosecurity portfolio. Founders Pledge separately recommends NTI \| bio as a high-impact biosecurity funder.[^3]

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions questions={[
  "Can free open-source synthesis screening achieve adoption rates sufficient to meaningfully reduce misuse risk, given that only 15% of providers currently screen?",
  "Will international standards harmonization succeed across jurisdictions with different regulatory cultures and enforcement capacities?",
  "How will synthesis screening adapt to rapidly advancing AI capabilities that may enable novel biological threats beyond current screening databases?",
  "Can IBBIS scale its team and operations fast enough to meet the pace of biotechnology proliferation?",
  "Will the EU Biotech Act and similar regulations include enforceable biosecurity provisions, or will screening remain voluntary?",
  "How effective are customer screening approaches compared to sequence screening for preventing misuse?"
