## Overview

The collapse of <EntityLink id="E856">FTX</EntityLink> in November 2022 was a defining crisis for the effective altruism (EA) movement. Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the founder of FTX, had been one of EA's most prominent and financially significant members, pledging the majority of his wealth to effective causes and channeling hundreds of millions of dollars through the <EntityLink id="E855">FTX Future Fund</EntityLink>. When FTX imploded following revelations about the entanglement of Alameda Research's finances with customer funds, the shock rippled immediately through EA institutions, damaging trust, disrupting funding pipelines, and prompting deep community self-examination.[^1]

EA institutions responded through a combination of public condemnation of SBF's alleged fraud, operational pauses on grant-making, emergency funding efforts to support affected organizations, and community surveys to assess the damage. The response was complicated by subsequent reporting indicating that EA leaders had received warnings about SBF's behavior and business practices as early as 2018—warnings that, according to sources interviewed by TIME, were downplayed or rationalized rather than acted upon.[^2] This revelation added a layer of institutional accountability questions to what might otherwise have been a straightforward case of external fraud.

Despite significant erosion of trust in EA leadership, survey data suggested that the EA community's attachment to its underlying philosophical principles remained comparatively resilient. The crisis nonetheless exposed structural vulnerabilities in EA's reliance on a small number of extremely wealthy donors, prompted calls for governance reform, and left a lasting mark on EA's public reputation and funding landscape.

## Background: EA's Ties to FTX

Prior to November 2022, SBF and other senior FTX and Alameda Research leaders collectively represented the second-largest group of benefactors to the EA movement, surpassed only by <EntityLink id="E552">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> and Good Ventures (the philanthropic vehicle of Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz).[^3] SBF had become publicly associated with EA's "earning to give" ethos—the idea that accumulating wealth through a high-impact career to donate aggressively could be more effective than direct nonprofit work.

The <EntityLink id="E855">FTX Future Fund</EntityLink>, a charitable organization bankrolled by SBF, had committed approximately \$160 million in grants and investments by September 2022 across a range of EA-aligned causes, including global health, biosecurity, and AI safety.[^3] This made it one of the most significant new philanthropic actors in the EA ecosystem in a very short time. Organizations ranging from university research centers to small nonprofits in the developing world had built multiyear plans around expected Future Fund support.

SBF's personal profile within EA was significant. Will MacAskill, the Oxford moral philosopher and co-founder of the <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>, had publicly promoted SBF as an exemplar of EA principles. The FTX collapse therefore implicated not just a peripheral donor but a central figure whose elevation had been sanctioned at the highest levels of EA's intellectual and organizational leadership.[^2]

## Immediate Institutional Response

The day FTX declared bankruptcy—November 11, 2022—the FTX Future Fund team announced their resignation, citing fundamental questions about FTX's legitimacy and integrity. The fund halted all grant processing. This left committed grants in limbo and forced recipient organizations to scramble for alternative funding.[^4] For example, Rajalakshmi Children Foundation, which had been expecting multiyear support from the Future Fund, received no communication from the FTX Foundation and had to seek emergency donors elsewhere.[^4]

MacAskill was among the EA leaders who responded publicly within days of the collapse. In statements circulated on social media, he expressed what he described as a combination of rage at SBF for allegedly deceiving him and self-criticism for having trusted SBF. He also emphasized that EA principles are fundamentally opposed to "ends justify the means" reasoning, positioning the alleged fraud as a violation of—rather than a product of—EA's philosophical commitments.[^5]

Peter Singer, widely regarded as the intellectual founder of the EA movement, defended EA in an interview with The Guardian in December 2022 while acknowledging the harm caused. According to the interview, Singer stated that "wise, effective altruists and utilitarians know that honesty is the best policy," and argued that the broader record of EA's "earning to give" approach remained net positive despite the FTX collapse.[^6]

<EntityLink id="E552">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> announced via the EA Forum that it was prepared to support charitable organizations impacted by FTX's collapse, stepping into the gap left by the Future Fund's sudden disappearance.[^4]

## Community Impact: Survey Data

A December 2022 survey conducted by Rethink Priorities in collaboration with the <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink> provided the most systematic picture of how the collapse affected the EA community.[^7]

The headline finding was that community satisfaction declined by approximately 0.5–1 points on a 10-point scale, with overall sentiment remaining on the positive side at roughly 7.5 out of 10. However, the distribution of specific concerns was striking:

- 58% of respondents reported the crisis gave them concerns about EA meta-organizations
- 55% reported concerns about the EA community and its norms
- 48% reported concerns about leaders of EA meta-organizations
- Over 30% reported substantially losing trust in EA public figures or leadership[^7]

The data also captured responses related to behavior change. Approximately 31% of respondents reported that they stopped referring to "EA" by name while continuing to promote EA ideas and projects, and 15% temporarily paused EA promotion entirely. Only 6% reported permanently ceasing EA promotion.[^8]

Notably, the philosophical core of EA appeared more insulated from the damage. Only 25% of respondents agreed that the crisis gave them concerns about EA principles or philosophy, compared to 66% who disagreed.[^7] This suggested that the damage was concentrated at the institutional and leadership level rather than the level of EA's foundational arguments.

On the question of whether EA had responded well to the crisis, 47% agreed and 21% disagreed, with the remainder neutral or ambivalent.[^7]

## Funding Consequences

The financial consequences of the collapse were significant. EA Funds donation inflows reportedly declined substantially in the period following the collapse. Some donors who had planned movement-building grants became more cautious, while a smaller number consciously increased their giving to compensate for the loss of FTX-linked funding.[^9]

Stanford's Center for Innovation in Global Health, which had received \$1.5 million from the Future Fund, removed public mention of the grant from its communications following the collapse.[^4] Across the broader EA ecosystem, organizations that had built multiyear plans around Future Fund commitments faced abrupt uncertainty. The collapse illustrated what critics described as a structural vulnerability in EA's funding model: excessive concentration of financial resources in a small number of donors whose wealth was tied to volatile and opaque asset classes.

New Giving What We Can pledges reportedly dropped by approximately 70% in the period following the collapse, and EA Forum metrics—posts and engagement levels—peaked around the time of the collapse before declining or reversing prior growth trends.[^9]

## Prior Warnings and Institutional Accountability

Perhaps the most damaging element of the post-collapse reckoning was the emergence of reporting indicating that EA leaders had received serious warnings about SBF's behavior years before the collapse. According to sources who spoke to TIME, concerns about Bankman-Fried's conduct at Alameda Research—including allegations of pervasive dishonesty, sloppy accounting, and rejection of corporate controls—had been raised within EA circles as early as 2018.[^2]

According to these sources, the concerns were characterized as typical startup disputes or dismissed as "he said-she said" rather than prompting substantive action. EA leaders declined or did not respond to requests from TIME to explain their reaction to these warnings and what steps, if any, they took in response.[^2] Sources familiar with the EA community at the time suggested it was implausible that prominent EA leaders were unaware of quite a lot of the details regarding Alameda's internal problems, describing the situation as a significant event within the EA community.[^2]

Federal prosecutors identified 2019 as the start of Bankman-Fried's alleged criminal fraud—after the initial warnings had been raised—and no sources alleged that EA leaders had advance knowledge of specific criminal conduct. Nevertheless, the pattern of downplaying credible concerns about a major donor raised serious questions about EA institutions' willingness to apply critical scrutiny to powerful figures within the movement.[^2]

MacAskill publicly acknowledged in the aftermath that the movement needed to engage in serious self-examination and that EA needed to make clear it does not see itself as above common-sense ethical norms.[^5]

## Governance and Structural Critiques

Beyond the specific failures related to SBF, critics argued that the FTX collapse reflected broader governance weaknesses within EA institutions. These included the use of small, homogeneous boards with limited independence from major donors, the absence of meaningful community input into major institutional decisions, and a broader cultural pattern of tolerating risks when the potential philanthropic payoff appeared large enough.[^10]

One framework applied to <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>'s parent entity, Effective Ventures, placed its board governance at an early "start-up" stage despite the organization running programs of considerably greater scale and maturity. Critics argued that advisory panels established to provide oversight had in practice been ineffective, with at least one notable panel dissolving without meaningful output.[^10]

The collapse was also cited as illustrating the risks of what some critics characterized as EA's role as a "playground for wealthy donors"—a dynamic in which EA's allocative and philosophical frameworks gave legitimacy to large concentrations of donor-controlled capital without adequate accountability mechanisms. The FTX Future Fund had grown extremely rapidly, committing \$160 million in under nine months, with limited external oversight.[^4]

## Criticisms and Controversies

Several distinct lines of criticism emerged from EA's response to the FTX collapse.

**Failure to act on warnings**: The most pointed criticism concerned the gap between EA's self-presentation as a movement committed to rigorous, evidence-based reasoning and its apparent failure to apply that standard to one of its most prominent funders. Critics argued that the downplaying of early warnings about SBF reflected either naivety unbecoming of professional ethicists or a more troubling willingness to overlook ethical concerns in exchange for access to large sums of money.[^2]

**Reputational damage and damage control**: Some observers characterized EA leaders' post-collapse public statements as belated damage control. MacAskill's emphasis that "earning to give" does not mean "ends justify the means" was seen by critics as addressing a concern that EA's own earlier promotion of SBF had helped to create.[^5]

**Broader EA cultural critique**: A strand of criticism argued that the FTX collapse was not an isolated aberration but a symptom of systemic issues—including EA's impartial utilitarian framework, its concentration of influence in a small intellectual elite, and its tendency to prioritize quantifiable impact metrics over more diffuse concerns about institutional culture, power dynamics, and governance.[^11]

**Counterarguments**: EA defenders noted that no criminal allegations were made against EA leaders, and that the underlying philosophical commitments of EA—rigorous reasoning, impartial concern for wellbeing, evidence-based giving—were not themselves implicated in the fraud. Survey data supported the view that EA community members largely distinguished between leadership failures and philosophical failures. Charlie Bresler of The Life You Can Save argued that the causes EA supports—global health, poverty alleviation, animal welfare—would not be durably harmed by the reputational fallout.[^4]

## Key Uncertainties

Several important questions about EA institutions' response to the FTX collapse remain unsettled or difficult to assess from available evidence:

- **Extent of prior knowledge**: The full picture of what EA leaders knew about SBF's conduct and when they knew it has not been definitively established. Leaders' own accounts have been limited, and independent investigation has been constrained by the absence of formal inquiries into EA institutions specifically.
- **Long-term funding impact**: While short-term metrics showed significant declines, the long-term trajectory of EA funding—and whether alternative donors fully compensated for the loss of FTX-linked giving—is not yet clear from available data.
- **Governance reform outcomes**: Calls for improved governance at EA institutions were widespread in the aftermath, but the extent to which concrete structural changes were implemented is not well-documented in available sources.
- **Reputational recovery**: Whether the EA brand has recovered among key audiences—academics, potential donors, students, policymakers—or whether the reputational damage has proved lasting is difficult to assess from sources available through early 2023.
