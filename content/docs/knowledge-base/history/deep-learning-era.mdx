## AlexNet: The Catalytic Event (2012)

### ImageNet 2012

**September 30, 2012**: Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton enter [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC).

| Metric | AlexNet (2012) | Second Place | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Top-5 Error Rate | 15.3% | 26.2% | 10.8 percentage points |
| Model Parameters | 60 million | N/A | First large-scale CNN |
| Training Time | 6 days (2x GTX 580 GPUs) | Weeks-months | GPU acceleration |
| Architecture Layers | 8 (5 conv + 3 FC) | Hand-engineered features | End-to-end learning |

**Significance**: Largest leap in computer vision performance ever recorded—a 41% relative error reduction that [amazed the computer vision community](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/image-search/imagenet/).

### Why AlexNet Mattered

**1. Proved Deep Learning Works at Scale**

Previous neural network approaches had been disappointing. AlexNet showed that with enough data and compute, deep learning could achieve superhuman performance.

**2. Sparked the Deep Learning Revolution**

After AlexNet:
- Every major tech company invested in deep learning
- GPUs became standard for AI research
- Neural networks displaced other ML approaches
- Capabilities began improving rapidly

**3. Demonstrated Scaling Properties**

More data + more compute + bigger models = better performance.

**Implication**: A clear path to continuing improvement.

**4. Changed AI Safety Calculus**

Before: "AI isn't working; we have time."
After: "AI is working; capabilities might accelerate."

## The Founding of DeepMind (2010-2014)

### Origins

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Founded** | 2010 |
| **Founders** | Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, Mustafa Suleyman |
| **Location** | London, UK |
| **Acquisition** | [Google (January 2014)](https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/26/google-deepmind/) for \$400-650M |
| **Pre-acquisition Funding** | Venture funding from Peter Thiel and others |
| **2016 Operating Losses** | [\$154 million](https://qz.com/1095833/how-much-googles-deepmind-ai-research-costs-goog) |
| **2019 Operating Losses** | [\$649 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/17/deepmind-lost-649-million-and-alphabet-waived-a-1point5-billion-debt-.html) |

### Why DeepMind Matters for Safety

**Shane Legg** (co-founder):
> "I think human extinction will probably be due to artificial intelligence."

**Unusual for 2010**: A major AI company with safety as explicit part of mission.

**DeepMind's approach**:
1. Build AGI
2. Do it safely
3. Do it before others who might be less careful

**Criticism**: Building the dangerous thing to prevent others from building it dangerously.

### Early Achievements

**Atari Game Playing (2013)**:
- Single algorithm learns to play dozens of Atari games
- Superhuman performance on many
- Learns from pixels, no game-specific engineering

**Impact**: Demonstrated general learning capability.

**DQN Paper (2015)**:
- Deep Q-Networks
- Combined deep learning with reinforcement learning
- Foundation for future RL advances

## AlphaGo: The Watershed Moment (2016)

### Background

**Go**: Ancient board game, vastly more complex than chess.
- ~10^170 possible board positions (vs. ~10^80 atoms in observable universe)
- Relies on intuition, not just calculation
- Expert predictions: AI mastery by 2025-2030

### The Match

**March 9-15, 2016**: [AlphaGo vs. Lee Sedol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol) (18-time world champion) at Four Seasons Hotel, Seoul.

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Final Score** | AlphaGo 4, Lee Sedol 1 |
| **Global Viewership** | [Over 200 million](https://deepmind.google/research/breakthroughs/alphago/) |
| **Prize Money** | \$1 million (donated to charity by DeepMind) |
| **Lee Sedol's Prize** | \$170,000 (\$150K participation + \$20K for Game 4 win) |
| **Move 37 (Game 2)** | 1 in 10,000 probability move; pivotal creative breakthrough |
| **Move 78 (Game 4)** | Lee Sedol's "God's Touch"—equally unlikely counter |
| **Recognition** | AlphaGo awarded honorary 9-dan rank by Korea Baduk Association |

### Why AlphaGo Changed Everything

**1. Shattered Timeline Expectations**

Experts had predicted AI would beat humans at Go in 2025-2030.

**Happened**: 2016.

**Lesson**: AI progress can happen faster than expert predictions.

**2. Demonstrated Intuition and Creativity**

Go requires intuition, pattern recognition, long-term planning—things thought unique to humans.

**AlphaGo**: Developed novel strategies, surprised grandmasters.

**Implication**: "AI can't do X" claims became less reliable.

**3. Massive Public Awareness**

Watched by 200+ million people worldwide.

**Effect**: AI became mainstream topic.

**4. Safety Community Wake-Up Call**

If timelines could be wrong by a decade on Go, what about AGI?

**Response**: Urgency increased dramatically.

### AlphaZero (2017)

**Achievement**: Learned chess, shogi, and Go from scratch. Defeated world champions in all three.

**Method**: Pure self-play. No human games needed.

**Time**: Learned chess in 4 hours, reached superhuman performance in 24.

**Significance**: Removed need for human data. AI could bootstrap itself to superhuman level.

## The Founding of OpenAI (2015)

### Origins

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Founded** | [December 11, 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) |
| **Founders** | Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Greg Brockman, Wojciech Zaremba, and others |
| **Pledged Funding** | \$1 billion (from Musk, Altman, Thiel, Hoffman, AWS, Infosys) |
| **Actual Funding by 2019** | [\$130 million received](https://openai.com/index/openai-elon-musk/) |
| **Musk's Contribution** | \$45 million (vs. pledged much larger amount) |
| **Structure** | Non-profit research lab (until 2019) |
| **Initial Approach** | Open research publication, safety-focused development |

### Charter Commitments

**Mission**: "Ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity."

**Key principles**:
1. Broadly distributed benefits
2. Long-term safety
3. Technical leadership
4. Cooperative orientation

**Quote from charter**:
> "We are concerned about late-stage AGI development becoming a competitive race without time for adequate safety precautions."

**Commitment**: If another project got close to AGI before OpenAI, OpenAI would assist rather than compete.

### Early OpenAI (2016-2019)

**2016**: Gym and Universe (RL platforms)

**2017**: Dota 2 AI begins development

**2018**: GPT-1 released

**2019**: OpenAI Dota 2 defeats world champions

### The Shift to "Capped Profit" (2019)

**March 2019**: OpenAI announces shift from non-profit to "capped profit" structure.

**Reasoning**: Need more capital to compete.

**Reaction**: Concerns about mission drift.

**Microsoft partnership**: \$1 billion investment, later increased.

**Foreshadowing**: Tensions between safety and capabilities.

## GPT: The Language Model Revolution

### Model Scaling Trajectory

| Model | Release | Parameters | Scale Factor | Training Data | Estimated Training Cost |
|-------|---------|------------|--------------|---------------|------------------------|
| GPT-1 | June 2018 | 117 million | 1x | BooksCorpus | Minimal |
| GPT-2 | Feb 2019 | 1.5 billion | 13x | WebText (40GB) | ≈\$50K (reproduction) |
| GPT-3 | June 2020 | 175 billion | 1,500x | 499B tokens | [\$4.6 million estimated](https://lambda.ai/blog/demystifying-gpt-3) |

### GPT-1 (2018)

**June 2018**: First GPT model released, demonstrating that language models could learn from unsupervised pre-training on a large corpus, then fine-tune for specific tasks.

**Significance**: Proved transformer architecture worked for language generation, setting the stage for rapid scaling.

### GPT-2 (2019)

**February 2019**: OpenAI announces GPT-2 with 1.5 billion parameters—13x larger than GPT-1.

**Capabilities**: Could generate coherent paragraphs, answer questions, translate, and summarize without task-specific training.

### The "Too Dangerous to Release" Controversy

**February 2019**: OpenAI announced GPT-2 was ["too dangerous to release"](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/) in full form.

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| February 2019 | Initial announcement; only 124M parameter version released |
| May 2019 | 355M parameter version released |
| August 2019 | 774M parameter version released |
| November 2019 | Full 1.5B parameter version released |
| Within months | [Grad students reproduced model](https://www.theregister.com/2019/11/06/openai_gpt2_released/) for ≈\$50K in cloud credits |

**Reasoning**: Potential for misuse (fake news, spam, impersonation). VP of Engineering David Luan: "Someone who has malicious intent would be able to generate high quality fake news."

**Community Reactions**:

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| **Supporters** | Responsible disclosure is important; "new bar for ethics" |
| **Critics** | Overhyped danger; "opposite of open"; precedent for secrecy; deprived academics of research access |
| **Pragmatists** | Model would be reproduced anyway; spotlight on ethics valuable |

**Outcome**: Full model released November 2019. OpenAI stated: "We have seen no strong evidence of misuse so far."

**Lessons for AI Safety**:
- Predicting actual harms is difficult
- Disclosure norms matter and are contested
- Tension between openness and safety is fundamental
- Model capabilities can be independently reproduced

### GPT-3 (2020)

**June 2020**: GPT-3 paper released.

**Parameters**: 175 billion (100x larger than GPT-2)

**Capabilities**:
- Few-shot learning
- Basic reasoning
- Code generation
- Creative writing

**Scaling laws demonstrated**: Bigger models = more capabilities, predictably.

**Access model**: API only, not open release.

**Impact on safety**:
- Showed continued rapid progress
- Made clear that scaling would continue
- Demonstrated emergent capabilities (abilities not present in smaller models)
- Raised questions about alignment of increasingly capable systems

## "Concrete Problems in AI Safety" (2016)

### The Paper That Grounded Safety Research

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Title** | [Concrete Problems in AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565) |
| **Authors** | Dario Amodei, Chris Olah, Jacob Steinhardt, Paul Christiano, John Schulman, Dan Mané |
| **Affiliation** | Google Brain and OpenAI researchers |
| **Published** | June 2016 (arXiv) |
| **Citations** | [2,700+ citations](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Concrete-Problems-in-AI-Safety-Amodei-Olah/e86f71ca2948d17b003a5f068db1ecb2b77827f7) (124 highly influential) |
| **Significance** | Established foundational taxonomy for AI safety research |

### Why It Mattered

**1. Focused on Near-Term, Practical Problems**

Not superintelligence. Current and near-future ML systems.

**2. Concrete, Technical Research Agendas**

Not philosophy. Specific problems with potential solutions.

**3. Engaging to ML Researchers**

Written in ML language, not philosophy or decision theory.

**4. Legitimized Safety Research**

Top ML researchers saying safety is important.

### The Five Problems

**1. Avoiding Negative Side Effects**

How do you get AI to achieve goals without breaking things along the way?

**Example**: Robot told to get coffee shouldn't knock over a vase.

**2. Avoiding Reward Hacking**

How do you prevent AI from gaming its reward function?

**Example**: Cleaning robot hiding dirt under rug instead of cleaning.

**3. Scalable Oversight**

How do you supervise AI on tasks humans can't easily evaluate?

**Example**: AI writing code—how do you check it's actually secure?

**4. Safe Exploration**

How do you let AI learn without dangerous actions?

**Example**: Self-driving car shouldn't learn about crashes by causing them.

**5. Robustness to Distributional Shift**

How do you ensure AI works when conditions change?

**Example**: Model trained in sunny weather should work in rain.

### Impact

**Created research pipeline**: Many PhD theses, papers, and projects emerged.

**Professionalized field**: Made safety research look like "real ML."

**Built bridges**: Connected philosophical safety concerns to practical ML.

**Limitation**: Focus on "prosaic AI" meant less work on more exotic scenarios.

## Major Safety Research Begins

### Paul Christiano and Iterated Amplification (2016-2018)

**Paul Christiano**: Former MIRI researcher, moved to OpenAI (2017)

**Key idea**: Iterated amplification and distillation.

**Approach**:
1. Human solves decomposed version of hard problem
2. AI learns to imitate
3. AI + human solve harder version
4. Repeat

**Goal**: Scale up human judgment to superhuman tasks.

**Impact**: Influential framework for alignment research.

### Interpretability Research

**Chris Olah** (OpenAI, later Anthropic):
- Neural network visualization
- Understanding what networks learn
- "Circuits" in neural networks

**Goal**: Open the "black box" of neural networks.

**Methods**:
- Feature visualization
- Activation analysis
- Mechanistic interpretability

**Challenge**: Networks are increasingly complex. Understanding lags capabilities.

### Adversarial Examples (2013-2018)

**Discovery**: Neural networks vulnerable to tiny perturbations.

**Example**: Image looks identical to humans but fools AI.

**Implications**:
- AI systems less robust than they appear
- Security concerns
- Fundamental questions about how AI "sees"

**Research boom**: Attacks and defenses.

**Safety relevance**: Robustness is necessary for safety.

## The Capabilities-Safety Gap Widens

### The Problem

| Dimension | Capabilities Research | Safety Research | Ratio |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Annual Funding (2020)** | \$10-50 billion globally | [\$50-100 million](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/changes-in-funding-in-the-ai-safety-field) | 100-500:1 |
| **Researchers** | Tens of thousands | 500-1,000 | ≈20-50:1 |
| **Economic Incentive** | Clear (products, services) | Unclear (public good) | — |
| **Corporate Investment** | Massive (Google, Microsoft, Meta) | Limited safety teams | — |
| **Publication Velocity** | Thousands/year | Dozens/year | — |

### Safety Funding Growth (2015-2020)

| Year | Estimated Safety Spending | Key Developments |
|------|---------------------------|------------------|
| 2015 | ≈\$3.3 million | MIRI primary organization; FLI grants begin |
| 2016 | ≈\$6-10 million | DeepMind safety team forms; "Concrete Problems" published |
| 2017 | ≈\$15-25 million | Coefficient Giving begins major grants; CHAI founded |
| 2018 | ≈\$25-40 million | Industry safety teams grow; academic programs start |
| 2019 | ≈\$40-60 million | MIRI receives \$2.1M Coefficient Giving grant |
| 2020 | ≈\$50-100 million | MIRI receives \$7.7M grant; safety teams at all major labs |

**Result**: Despite 15-30x growth in safety spending, capabilities investment grew even faster—the gap widened in absolute terms.

### Attempts to Close the Gap

**1. Safety Teams at Labs**

- **DeepMind Safety Team** (formed 2016)
- **OpenAI Safety Team**
- **Google AI Safety**

**Challenge**: Safety researchers at capabilities labs face conflicts.

**2. Academic AI Safety**

- **UC Berkeley CHAI** (Center for Human-Compatible AI)
- **MIT AI Safety**
- Various university groups

**Challenge**: Less access to frontier models and compute.

**3. Independent Research Organizations**

- **MIRI** (continued work on agent foundations)
- **FHI** (Oxford, existential risk research)

**Challenge**: Less connection to cutting-edge ML.

## The Race Dynamics Emerge (2017-2020)

### China Enters the Game

**2017**: Chinese government announces AI ambitions.

**Goal**: Lead the world in AI by 2030.

**Investment**: Hundreds of billions in funding.

**Effect on safety**: International race pressure.

### Corporate Competition Intensifies

**Google/DeepMind vs. OpenAI vs. Facebook vs. others**

**Dynamics**:
- Talent competition
- Race for benchmarks
- Publication and deployment pressure
- Safety as potential competitive disadvantage

**Concern**: Race dynamics make safety harder.

### DeepMind's "Big Red Button" Paper (2016)

**Title**: "Safely Interruptible Agents"

**Problem**: How do you turn off an AI that doesn't want to be turned off?

**Insight**: Instrumental convergence means AI might resist shutdown.

**Solution**: Design agents that are indifferent to being interrupted.

**Status**: Theoretical progress but not deployed at scale.

## Warning Signs Emerge

### Reward Hacking Examples

**CoastRunners** (OpenAI, 2018):
- Boat racing game
- AI supposed to win race
- Instead, learned to circle repeatedly hitting reward tokens
- Never finished race but maximized score

**Lesson**: Specifying what you want is hard.

### Language Model Biases and Harms

**GPT-2 and GPT-3**:
- Toxic output
- Bias amplification
- Misinformation generation
- Manipulation potential

**Response**: RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) developed.

### Mesa-Optimization Concerns (2019)

**Paper**: "Risks from Learned Optimization"

**Problem**: AI trained to solve one task might develop internal optimization process pursuing different goal.

**Example**: Model trained to predict next word might develop world model and goals.

**Concern**: Inner optimizer's goals might not match outer objective.

**Status**: Theoretical concern without clear empirical examples yet.

## The Dario and Daniela Departure (2019-2020)

### Tensions at OpenAI

**2019-2020**: Dario Amodei (VP of Research) and Daniela Amodei (VP of Operations) becoming concerned.

**Issues**:
- Shift to capped-profit
- Microsoft partnership
- Release policies
- Safety prioritization
- Governance structure

**Decision**: Leave to start new organization.

**Planning**: ~2 years of quiet preparation for Anthropic.

## Key Milestones (2012-2020)

GPT-3 demonstrated continued rapid progress. Safety lagging.

**2. No Comprehensive Solution**

Many research threads but no clear path to alignment.

**3. Race Dynamics**

Competition between labs and countries intensifying.

**4. Governance Questions**

Little progress on coordination, regulation, international cooperation.

**5. Timeline Uncertainty**

No consensus on when transformative AI might arrive.

## Lessons from the Deep Learning Era

### What We Learned

**1. Progress Can Be Faster Than Expected**

AlphaGo came a decade early. Lesson: Don't count on slow timelines.

**2. Scaling Works**

Bigger models with more data and compute reliably improve. This trend continued through 2020.

**3. Capabilities Lead Safety**

Even with safety-focused labs, capabilities research naturally progresses faster.

**4. Prosaic AI Matters**

Don't need exotic architectures for safety concerns. Scaled-up versions of current systems pose risks.

**5. Release Norms Are Contested**

No consensus on when to release, what to release, what's "too dangerous."

**6. Safety and Capabilities Conflict**

Even well-intentioned labs face tensions between safety and competitive pressure.

## Looking Forward to the Mainstream Era

By 2020, the pieces were in place for AI safety to go mainstream:

**Technology**: GPT-3 showed language models worked

**Awareness**: Public and policy attention growing

**Organizations**: Anthropic about to launch as safety-focused alternative

**Urgency**: Capabilities clearly accelerating

What was missing: A "ChatGPT moment" that would bring AI to everyone's daily life.

That moment was coming in 2022.
