## Overview

Earning to Give (commonly abbreviated E2G or EtG) is a career strategy associated with the <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink> ecosystem, in which individuals deliberately pursue high-earning jobs—typically in finance, technology, or professional services—and donate a large fraction of their income to highly effective charities, rather than working directly in nonprofit or impact-focused roles.[^1][^2] The underlying logic rests on a comparative advantage argument: if someone is better suited to a lucrative career than to direct charity work, their donations may fund multiple specialists working on pressing problems, producing more aggregate good than the donor could generate through direct employment alone.[^3]

The strategy gained significant prominence around 2011–2012, when key figures in the emerging effective altruism movement began promoting it as a concrete way for talented individuals—particularly those entering finance or entrepreneurship—to channel their skills toward global welfare. <EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> and Giving What We Can became the primary institutional homes for earning-to-give guidance, with practitioners typically committing to donate at least 10% of their income via the Giving What We Can pledge, though many commit to significantly higher percentages.[^4] One EA Forum retrospective documented a practitioner who donated over £1.5 million across ten years, with major recipients including Giving What We Can, 80,000 Hours, the Against Malaria Foundation, and GiveWell-managed funds.[^5]

The strategy's prominence has shifted considerably since its early years. By approximately 2015, major EA organizations had begun de-emphasizing E2G in favor of direct work in research, policy, and advocacy. This shift was reinforced by the 2022 FTX collapse, which brought significant reputational damage to earn-to-give as a philosophy, and by the EA movement's broader turn toward longtermism—a set of concerns not easily addressed through the kind of quantifiable, charity-directed donations that E2G had traditionally supported. Nevertheless, E2G has seen partial revival in discourse following recognized funding shortfalls in EA-adjacent organizations, and <EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> continues to recommend the strategy for individuals who are genuinely well-suited to higher-earning paths.[^2]

## History

### Origins and Intellectual Roots

The philosophical precedent for earning to give is often traced to John Wesley's 18th-century Methodist preaching, summarized as "gain all you can, save all you can, give all you can." More direct intellectual roots lie in Peter Singer's 1972 essay "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," which argued that affluent individuals in wealthy countries have strong obligations to donate to alleviate global poverty.[^6] Singer's framework influenced the proto-EA communities that coalesced in the mid-2000s around Oxford philosophers Toby Ord and William MacAskill, who had begun researching cost-effective global poverty charities.[^6]

The institutional scaffolding for earning to give emerged from several overlapping organizations. GiveWell was founded in 2007 by Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld to rigorously evaluate charities and direct donations toward the most effective interventions—it has reportedly directed over \$172 million to effective causes.[^6] Giving What We Can launched in November 2009, founded by Toby Ord, William MacAskill, and Bernadette Young; Ord pledged to live on £18,000 per year and donate the remainder of his income, and thirty initial pledgers joined at launch.[^6] <EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> soft-launched in 2011 under MacAskill and Ben Todd as a career advice resource initially called High Impact Careers, with the <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink> forming as an umbrella organization.[^6]

### Formalization (2011–2012)

The term "effective altruism" was coined in 2011, and earning to give emerged as one of its most discussed and publicly recognized strategies around 2012. A notable episode in this period involved MacAskill pitching the strategy to Sam Bankman-Fried, then an MIT undergraduate, encouraging him to pursue a high-earning finance career and donate the proceeds to effective causes.[^6] Bankman-Fried went on to found FTX and became one of the most prominent—and later most controversial—figures associated with the strategy.

### De-emphasis and Reassessment (2015–Present)

By approximately 2015, central EA organizations had begun shifting their emphasis away from earning to give. According to accounts in the EA community, this reflected concerns including the risk of moral corrosion in high-finance environments, over-reliance on volatile funding sources, and a growing sense that direct work in research and policy offered higher marginal returns than additional funding.[^7] <EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> and related organizations increasingly steered high-potential individuals toward direct impact careers rather than high-earning paths.

The EA movement's turn toward longtermism—with its focus on speculative but potentially enormous risks like advanced AI—also complicated the E2G calculus. Longtermist cause areas are not easily evaluated using the randomized controlled trial frameworks that had made global health charities legible and fundable targets for E2G donations.[^7]

The FTX collapse in late 2022, which resulted in Bankman-Fried's criminal conviction for fraud, represented a significant reputational blow. By mid-2022, Bankman-Fried had reportedly donated \$36.5 million to EA organizations, much of which was later revealed to have come from misappropriated customer funds.[^8] The episode renewed scrutiny of whether the earn-to-give framework adequately accounted for the ethical risks of aggressive wealth accumulation without sufficient oversight.

Despite this, discussions on the EA Forum from 2023–2024 suggest partial reassessment: as EA-adjacent organizations confronted funding shortfalls, some observers noted a renewed appreciation for E2G contributions.[^7] Giving What We Can's 2025 strategy, announced in late 2024, shifted focus toward scaling the 10% Pledge to a broader audience rather than specifically promoting E2G as a distinct program, reducing dedicated E2G support to approximately 0.5 FTE within the organization.[^9]

## The Core Mechanism

### Comparative Advantage Logic

The theoretical foundation for earning to give rests on comparative advantage: if an individual is significantly more productive in a high-earning role than in direct impact work, and if the organizations they fund can deploy capital effectively, then the expected value of their donations may exceed the expected value of their direct labor. According to <EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink>, E2G is most applicable when a person has a strong fit for a high-earning career, wants to build career capital in a lucrative field while staying engaged with social impact, or is uncertain about which problems are most pressing.[^2]

### Donation Commitments and Structures

Practitioners typically commit to donating 20–50% of their total salary, with some exceeding 50%.[^1] The Giving What We Can 10% Pledge functions as a common entry point and public commitment mechanism, though survey data suggests most EAs donate less than this threshold.[^4] More ambitious commitments are made via organizations including Founders Pledge, which targets entrepreneurs, and Ambitious Impact's Founding to Give program for those pursuing business ventures.[^1]

Common career paths for E2G practitioners include quantitative trading and other finance roles, given their high earnings potential.[^1] Practitioners are generally advised to direct donations toward charities evaluated as highly effective and funding-constrained, rather than large, well-resourced institutions likely to receive donations regardless.

### Flexibility as a Feature

Proponents highlight several practical advantages of E2G relative to direct work. Donors can shift their philanthropic focus across causes without needing to change careers, and can use donor-advised funds to delay allocation decisions until they have better information.[^10] If a funded organization becomes less effective, donors can redirect support more easily than an employee can change employers. Additionally, some argue that high-earning roles build transferable career capital—skills and networks that may enable later pivots into direct impact work.[^10]

## Current Adoption Rates

Rethink Priorities EA Survey data found that approximately 15% of EAs actively practice earning to give, though this figure varies based on definitional choices.[^11] The data reveals a pattern described as an engagement paradox: highly engaged EAs are less likely to pursue E2G careers (around 25% among non-student EAs) compared to less engaged EAs (38–48%), suggesting the strategy may not align well with deeper EA commitment levels.[^11] Most EAs donate less than the 10% Giving What We Can target, though there is a notable clustering around 10%, likely reflecting the pledge's normative influence and broader tithing traditions.[^11]

Nearly 10,000 people have taken the 10% Pledge as of recent estimates, donating roughly \$50 million annually to high-impact charities.[^9] The broader effective giving ecosystem reportedly grew approximately 10% from 2023 to 2024, with money moved rising from around \$1.1 billion to \$1.2 billion across organizations including Founders Pledge and the Navigation Fund.[^9]

## Criticisms and Concerns

### The FTX Collapse and Governance Failures

The most high-profile criticism of earning to give concerns Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX collapse. Bankman-Fried had been directly introduced to the strategy by William MacAskill and became one of its most prominent advocates and practitioners, pledging to donate the bulk of his FTX fortune to EA causes. His conviction for fraud—and the revelation that much of what he donated came from misappropriated customer funds—prompted critics to characterize his trajectory as illustrating the philosophical risks of an ethics framework that prioritizes outcomes without sufficient attention to process constraints.[^8] Some critics described the episode as producing a kind of ethical inversion, in which utilitarian rationalization licensed behaviors that more deontological frameworks would clearly prohibit.

### Opportunity Cost and Replaceability

A recurring criticism within the EA community itself concerns the replaceability of E2G practitioners. <EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> has argued that E2G careers typically have higher replaceability than direct work in EA organizations: if an E2G practitioner leaves a finance role, another person will likely fill it without donating significant fractions of their salary, but if they leave a specialized direct-work role, the position may go unfilled or be filled less effectively.[^12] This suggests that the counterfactual impact of direct work may be higher than a simple salary comparison implies.

A 2014 analysis suggested that mixing approaches—maintaining full-time employment while dedicating significant free time to EA volunteering and projects—may outperform pure E2G in both impact and learning about comparative advantage.[^12]

### Non-Salary Factors

When evaluating career options for E2G, salary alone can be misleading. An analysis by <EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> found that law appeared to be among the best E2G options based on salary data alone, but when job satisfaction, skill development, and alignment with EA values were incorporated, it ranked considerably lower.[^12] This highlights that simplistic salary-based comparisons may systematically misidentify optimal E2G careers.

### Systemic and Justice Critiques

External critics, including journalists and philosophers, have raised concerns about the systemic implications of earning to give. Some argue that pursuing lucrative roles in finance or other high-earning sectors can perpetuate or depend on the very economic structures that generate global poverty and inequality—making E2G a form of attempting to remedy symptoms rather than causes.[^13] Philosopher Stephen Darwall has argued from a justice-based perspective that utilitarian frameworks underlying much EA reasoning inadequately account for relationships of mutual accountability and equal respect, prioritizing aggregate outcomes over relational fairness.[^13]

Journalists including David Brooks and John Humphrys raised concerns about motivational drift—the risk that immersion in wealth-maximizing environments erodes the altruistic motivations that initially prompted commitment to high-donation pledges.[^13] Peter Singer and William MacAskill have responded by pointing to sustained examples of practitioners maintaining commitments over many years, though they acknowledge the debate.[^13]

### Longtermism and Measurement Challenges

The EA movement's shift toward longtermism has created a mismatch between earning to give's traditional strengths and its current application. E2G works best when donations can be directed toward organizations with legible, measurable impact—as in global health charities evaluated using randomized controlled trials. Longtermist cause areas, including AI safety and biosecurity, rely on speculative arguments about low-probability, high-magnitude risks that are difficult or impossible to verify empirically.[^7] This makes it harder to justify E2G donations to longtermist causes using the same evidentiary standards that motivated the strategy's early adherents.

### Community Perception and Cultural Dynamics

Within EA circles, E2G has become increasingly associated with a kind of unconventionality or awkwardness, particularly in offline settings.[^7] The strategy received considerable mainstream media attention in its early years, much of it negative, which some EA community members believe damaged both E2G's reputation and the movement's broader public image.[^7] The engagement paradox—in which deeper EA involvement is negatively correlated with E2G adoption—raises questions about whether encouraging more E2G adoption would require restructuring EA community norms and spaces to accommodate a different type of participant than currently predominates.[^11]

### Ethical Risks of High-Earning Environments

Critics note that E2G requires practitioners to maintain morally neutral or positive employment, but that high-earning roles in finance and related sectors can create situations where this requirement is violated—either through involvement in harmful investment strategies, contributions to economic inequality, or complicity in industry practices that conflict with EA values.[^10] Some analysts recommend that practitioners considering more ambitious E2G strategies—aiming for very substantial wealth accumulation—establish formal governance structures and pre-planned decision frameworks to reduce the risk of poor judgment as wealth and incentives shift.[^3]

## Key Uncertainties

Several questions remain genuinely unresolved in the E2G literature and community discussions:

- **Optimal E2G prevalence**: There is ongoing debate about whether the EA community should encourage more E2G adoption. One view holds that E2G should be prioritized given funding gaps and the community's absorption capacity; another emphasizes building broader norms of donation without positioning E2G as a primary path.[^11]
- **Counterfactual impact of funding**: The value of E2G donations depends heavily on whether funded organizations genuinely face binding funding constraints. If major funders like <EntityLink id="E552">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> adequately cover priority areas, marginal E2G donations may generate less value than assumed.[^13]
- **Long-run motivational stability**: Whether E2G practitioners maintain their donation commitments over decades in high-earning environments remains an open empirical question. The available retrospective evidence is limited and likely subject to selection bias toward those who maintained their commitments long enough to write about them.
- **Relationship to direct talent needs**: As AI safety and related fields expand, the relative scarcity of funding versus skilled direct workers may shift, potentially making E2G relatively less valuable compared to direct careers over time.
