## Overview

Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender, cultivated substantial relationships with prominent researchers in artificial intelligence and adjacent scientific fields through a combination of foundation grants, direct funding proposals, and personal networking. Documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice beginning in January 2026 revealed that his ties to the scientific community were deeper than previously known, involving nearly 30 scientists and millions of dollars in support.[^1] His interest in AI focused specifically on artificial general intelligence (AGI), with documented involvement in facial recognition research, robotic embodiment projects, and cognitive science symposia.

A notable and troubling aspect of these connections is that many continued well after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor and his subsequent registration as a sex offender. Institutions including Harvard and MIT received or sought Epstein funding during this period, and some researchers hosted him at academic facilities or on his private island years after his criminal history was publicly known. The release of the Epstein files has raised renewed questions about ethical standards and judgment, considering that many interactions continued after Epstein's 2008 conviction.[^2]

Epstein reportedly characterized his philanthropic approach as targeting researchers who did not fit conventional academic molds — scientists working on ambitious or unconventional problems that struggled to attract traditional funding.[^3] Whether this self-presentation reflects genuine intellectual interest or a strategy for gaining access to academic communities and their members remains a matter of interpretation. Epstein gave out much of his money anonymously, citing both a preference for privacy and an acknowledgment that his notoriety could be "a burden to grantees."

## History and Key Relationships

### Ben Goertzel and Early AGI Funding

Epstein's documented interest in artificial general intelligence dates to at least 2001, when he provided a \$100,000 grant from the Jeffrey Epstein Foundation to Ben Goertzel for AGI research.[^4] Goertzel, a computer scientist who later became known for founding SingularityNET, became a significant intermediary between Epstein and other researchers in the field.

Goertzel served as vice-chairman of Humanity+ (formerly the World Transhumanist Association). Epstein donated \$120,000 to Humanity+, a portion of which covered Goertzel's salary as vice-chairman.[^8] In 2011, Epstein's foundation separately donated \$20,000 to Humanity+.[^4]

**Hong Kong funding scheme**: Between 2010 and 2015, Epstein pledged at least \$113,000 to Goertzel, channeled through Humanity+ to Goertzel's company Novamente. This arrangement enabled Novamente to serve as an "industry sponsor" for three Hong Kong Polytechnic University research projects, helping those projects secure approximately HK\$8.9 million in public research funding.[^9] Goertzel has since expressed regret: "Looking back, I regret knowing the guy, or taking his money, or having anything to do with the guy."

In 2009, Goertzel introduced Epstein via email to Itamar Arel, then an associate professor of computer science at the University of Tennessee, who was working on a machine learning project focused on AGI.[^5] This introduction initiated the most detailed AI funding relationship documented in the released files.

### The Arel Project and the "Robotic AGI Toddler" Proposal

Arel had developed a model called DeSTIN — a deep learning system capable of limited facial recognition — using UT graduate students.[^5] Epstein expressed interest in Arel's work, and financed travel for both Arel and Goertzel to visit him at his Palm Beach home in 2009, one year after Epstein's 2008 guilty plea.[^5]

By March 2010, Arel and Goertzel had prepared a formal research and development proposal for the Epstein Foundation. The proposal carried a \$3 million price tag and aimed to develop what the document described as a "robotic AGI toddler" — an AGI system designed to demonstrate the general intelligence of a 3–4 year old child, implemented through virtual world characters and humanoid robots.[^5] Arel was named as the primary investigator, with the DeSTIN facial recognition system intended as a core component. Whether the project was ultimately funded at the proposed level has not been confirmed in the released documents. Arel departed from his position at the University of Tennessee in 2021 and later became VP of Voice AI at Salesforce.[^5]

### MIT Connections

Epstein's relationship with MIT extended across multiple researchers and totaled \$850,000 in donations between 2002 and 2017.

**Marvin Minsky**: Minsky, a foundational figure in AI and co-founder of MIT's AI Laboratory (not the Media Lab), received a \$100,000 research grant from Epstein in 2002 — documented as Epstein's first donation to MIT.[^4] Minsky organized two academic symposia on Epstein's private island, Little Saint James, in 2002 and again in 2011.[^4] The 2011 symposium is particularly notable: it occurred after Epstein had already been convicted of sex offenses. According to an email from MIT Media Lab co-founder Nicholas Negroponte, Minsky was Epstein's closest friend at MIT and "even visited him in jail."[^4]

**Joscha Bach**: German AI scientist and cognitive architect Joscha Bach received extensive personal financial support from Epstein while at MIT's Media Lab, including rent, flights, medical bills, and tuition support, from approximately 2013 to 2019.[^8] Bach has worked on cognitive architectures — computational models that aim to replicate aspects of human cognition. As late as 2018, Bach acknowledged "generous support" and "discussions" from the Epstein Foundation in a paper presented at the International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence.[^8]

**Seth Lloyd**: MIT quantum engineer Seth Lloyd met Epstein in 2004 at a party hosted by John Brockman (literary agent and Edge Foundation founder). Lloyd accepted grants from Epstein in 2012 and 2017 to support his MIT lab.[^10] An MIT fact-finding report concluded that Lloyd "knowingly failed to flag Epstein's criminal record when processing the 2012 gifts" and had also accepted a personal payment from Epstein more than a decade earlier.[^10] MIT placed Lloyd on paid administrative leave and described his handling of the donations as "a serious lapse in judgment." Joi Ito, the director of the MIT Media Lab, also resigned after acknowledging that his personal ventures outside MIT had received \$1.25 million from Epstein.[^10]

### Nick Bostrom, Humanity+, and the Longtermism Network

Nick Bostrom, philosopher and founder of the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) at Oxford, is linked to Epstein primarily through Humanity+ and the Edge Foundation network. Humanity+ had originally been the World Transhumanist Association, which Bostrom co-founded in 1998. The \$120,000 Epstein donation to Humanity+ (described above in the Goertzel section, which it partially funded) connects Bostrom to Epstein's funding network indirectly, via the organization he helped create.[^8]

Bostrom, considered one of the founding figures of longtermism and existential risk research, began attending Edge Foundation events regularly after Epstein's 2008 conviction. Epstein funded the Edge Foundation for approximately two decades, and its billionaire dinners included tech figures such as the founders of Google, Amazon, and SpaceX.[^8]

The FHI closed in 2024 amid separate controversies. Whether Epstein's funding relationships had any influence on the intellectual development of longtermism as a movement is not established by the available documents.

### MIRI (Machine Intelligence Research Institute)

In 2009, MIRI — then known as the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI), the early AI safety organization later renamed MIRI — received \$50,000 from Epstein's COUQ Foundation.[^4] MIRI is one of the earliest dedicated AI safety organizations, focused on ensuring beneficial AGI. The donation is documented in public records, though no further Epstein donations to MIRI have been reported.

### Harvard's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics

The most extensively documented institutional relationship involved Harvard's Program for Evolutionary Dynamics (PED), directed by mathematician and evolutionary dynamics researcher Martin Nowak. Epstein was admitted as a Visiting Fellow in Harvard's Psychology Department for the 2005–2006 academic year.[^6] He subsequently maintained access to a personal office within Nowak's PED laboratory, reportedly visiting over 40 times through 2018 and typically accompanied by young women serving as assistants.[^4]

Internal Harvard communications reveal that between 2010 and 2014, Nowak and others actively sought ways to accept Epstein funding for PED. A January 2010 email described Nowak as trying to find a way to have Epstein give PED funds.[^6] Harvard's Vice President for Administration and Finance later requested a meeting on the question of Epstein funding, and some officials reportedly argued that the research benefits of Epstein's support outweighed reputational concerns — a judgment that has been widely criticized.[^6]

Epstein's visits to the PED lab ended after PED researchers complained to Nowak. In 2021, Nowak was suspended from supervising undergraduate research for two years, and the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics was permanently closed.[^4]

Epstein's total pledged funding to Harvard was documented at \$30 million, of which \$6.5 million was specifically directed to PED.[^6]

### The Edge Foundation

Epstein funded the Edge Foundation — an intellectual salon network that brought together prominent scientists, technologists, and entrepreneurs — for approximately two decades.[^8] Edge events included annual billionaire dinners attended by figures such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Sergey Brin, and leaders in AI and technology policy. Epstein appeared on confidential Edge email lists alongside these figures. The Edge Foundation served as an informal networking infrastructure through which Epstein maintained access to prominent researchers across multiple fields.

## Criticisms and Concerns

### Continued Relationships After Conviction

Perhaps the most serious criticism emerging from the released documents is that many of these academic relationships continued, and in some cases deepened, after Epstein's 2008 conviction and registration as a sex offender. Minsky's organization of an island symposium in 2011, Joscha Bach's personal funding through 2019, Seth Lloyd's 2017 donation, Epstein's 40-plus visits to the Harvard PED lab through 2018, and the ongoing efforts by some faculty to attract Epstein funding during this period all represent documented instances in which Epstein's criminal history was apparently insufficient to sever academic ties.[^4][^6]

### Use of Students in Epstein-Funded Research

Reporting on the UT case highlighted that Arel used graduate students to develop the DeSTIN AI system that was the subject of Epstein's funding interest.[^5] Questions have been raised about whether those students were aware of the funding source and its implications, and about the responsibilities of principal investigators when accepting money from individuals with Epstein's profile.

### Institutional Decision-Making

Harvard's internal review documented that some administrators made affirmative decisions to continue accepting or seeking Epstein funds despite knowledge of his conviction. The reasoning that research benefits outweighed reputational risk has been widely criticized as a failure of institutional ethical judgment.[^6] Harvard's own review process was slow, with Epstein's access continuing for years before complaints from researchers and a survivor advocacy group prompted action.[^6]

MIT's 2020 fact-finding report similarly found that administrators created informal frameworks to accept "small, anonymous gifts" from Epstein even after his conviction, treating him as a "controversial donor" whose money could be accepted under the right conditions.[^10]

### Anonymous Giving as a Strategy

Epstein deliberately structured many donations to flow anonymously, reportedly to avoid publicity and to avoid his "notoriety" being "a burden to grantees." This approach made it easier for institutional officials to accept funds without triggering formal review processes, and the 2012 MIT gifts — routed anonymously — were specifically described as a "trial balloon" to test MIT's willingness to accept donations post-conviction.[^10]

### Search Engine Manipulation

Documents released by Congress in November 2025 revealed that Epstein hired consultants to conduct search engine optimization designed to downrank news stories about his conviction and remove what were described as "toxic suggested search terms" from search engine results.[^4] This effort to manage his public profile online may have helped sustain his credibility in academic circles during the period when he continued to secure research relationships.

### Responses from Researchers

Some researchers named in the documents have sought to characterize their involvement as limited. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely stated that he had encountered Epstein on only four occasions over nearly a decade and that his correspondence was infrequent, largely logistical, and often mediated by assistants, and that he had no financial, professional, or ongoing relationship with Epstein.[^7] Cognitive psychologist Howard Gardner stated he had never had any knowledge or intimation of what he called the darker sides of Epstein's conduct and expressed regret at not having asked more questions.[^2] Goertzel stated he regretted the relationship. These responses illustrate the range of proximity that different researchers had to Epstein and the varying degrees of awareness of his conduct.

## Key Uncertainties

Several important questions remain unresolved in the public record:

- **Whether the \$3 million AGI toddler proposal was actually funded**: The documents confirm the proposal was drafted and submitted, but do not confirm whether Epstein's foundation provided the requested amount.
- **The extent of student involvement**: It is unclear precisely how many students worked on Epstein-funded projects or what they were told about the funding source.
- **Epstein's actual scientific influence**: Whether Epstein's funding shaped research directions in any meaningful way, or whether the money was accepted with minimal intellectual influence, is difficult to assess from available documents.
- **Institutional knowledge gaps**: The degree to which administrators at MIT, Harvard, and UT were aware of the full extent of Epstein's involvement at various points in time remains partially unclear.
- **Scope of AI safety community exposure**: The MIRI donation and Humanity+ connections suggest Epstein had peripheral contact with the early AI safety community, but the extent of any intellectual or financial influence on that community's development is not established.
