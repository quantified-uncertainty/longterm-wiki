## Overview

The November 2022 collapse of <EntityLink id="ftx">FTX</EntityLink> stands as one of the most consequential financial frauds in the history of cryptocurrency, exposing a range of warning signs that, in retrospect, were either ignored or insufficiently scrutinized. At the time of its failure, FTX was the world's second or third largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, with a peak valuation of \$32 billion and over one million users. Its founder, <EntityLink id="sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</EntityLink> (SBF), had cultivated a public reputation as both a crypto prodigy and an effective altruist, making substantial pledges to philanthropic causes — including donations to the <EntityLink id="ftx-future-fund">FTX Future Fund</EntityLink>, which supported AI risk research — while positioning FTX as a responsible actor in an otherwise chaotic industry.[^1][^2]

Beneath this presentation, a cluster of structural vulnerabilities had been accumulating for years. These included a reckless commingling of customer funds with those of FTX's sister trading firm, Alameda Research; a dangerous overreliance on FTT, FTX's own native token, as a primary reserve asset; chronic failures of internal governance; and an almost complete absence of meaningful regulatory oversight. When CoinDesk published a report on November 2, 2022 revealing the extent of Alameda Research's exposure to FTT, the resulting panic triggered a cascade of events — Binance's liquidation of its FTT holdings, a mass customer bank run, and ultimately FTX's bankruptcy filing nine days later — that wiped out billions in customer assets and left the broader cryptocurrency industry badly shaken.[^3][^4]

The FTX collapse has since become a widely cited case study in how hype, inadequate due diligence, and regulatory gaps can obscure serious fraud. It has prompted renewed calls for bank-like regulatory frameworks in the crypto sector, independent auditing requirements, and greater scrutiny of related-party transactions between crypto exchanges and affiliated trading firms. The warning signs discussed in this article were largely visible in public data or should have been discoverable through standard due diligence — making the failure not only a story of fraud, but of collective oversight failures across investors, auditors, regulators, and the broader public.[^5][^6]

## History and Timeline

### Founding and Rise

FTX was founded by <EntityLink id="sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</EntityLink>, who had previously established Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency-focused hedge fund. The exchange launched as a Bahamas-based platform offering derivatives, leveraged tokens, and spot trading in cryptocurrencies, and grew rapidly through aggressive marketing — including high-profile Super Bowl advertisements, celebrity endorsements, and SBF's prominent philanthropic persona.[^1] By mid-2021, FTX had become one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, and SBF's personal net worth was estimated at around \$16 billion.[^4]

The close relationship between FTX and Alameda Research was present from the very beginning and would prove to be a central vulnerability. Both entities were effectively under SBF's control, and the financial boundaries between them were blurred in ways that would only become fully apparent after the collapse.[^3]

### The November 2022 Collapse

The proximate trigger of the collapse was a CoinDesk report published on November 2, 2022, which revealed that a large portion of Alameda Research's balance sheet consisted of FTT — the token that FTX itself had created and issued.[^3][^4] This circular arrangement meant that both FTX's exchange reserves and Alameda's trading capital were substantially backed by an asset whose value was dependent on confidence in FTX itself.

On November 6, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) announced that Binance would liquidate its approximately \$580 million in FTT holdings, citing concerns about FTX's financial health.[^3] The announcement triggered a sharp decline in FTT's price and a surge in customer withdrawal requests. Within roughly 72 hours, customers had attempted to withdraw approximately \$6 billion, representing approximately 37% of FTX's customer funds — nearly all in a two-day window.[^7]

FTX froze withdrawals on November 8. On the same day, Binance briefly announced a tentative agreement to acquire FTX, only to withdraw the following day after reviewing FTX's books and concluding that the problems were beyond its ability or willingness to address.[^3][^4] On November 11, FTX, Alameda Research, and more than 100 affiliated entities filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. SBF resigned as CEO, and John J. Ray III — who had previously overseen the Enron bankruptcy proceedings — was appointed as the new CEO.[^3]

John J. Ray III's appointment carried symbolic weight: he had been brought in to manage one of the largest corporate fraud cases in U.S. history (Enron) and was now overseeing what he later described in court filings as a more complete absence of trustworthy financial information than anything he had encountered in over 40 years of legal and restructuring work. His declaration in the FTX bankruptcy filing stated: "Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information."[^9]

Within days, the Wall Street Journal reported that FTX had lent customer deposits to Alameda to cover its liabilities — a practice that top executives had been aware of.[^3] In the early hours after the bankruptcy filing, approximately \$473 million in unauthorized transfers were also reported.[^4] U.S. federal prosecutors in New York launched an investigation on November 14, 2022.

### Legal Aftermath

SBF was convicted on all seven fraud counts in November 2023 and sentenced to 25 years in prison in March 2024. Caroline Ellison (former CEO of Alameda Research) and Gary Wang (FTX co-founder) cooperated with prosecutors; both pleaded guilty. Ellison was sentenced to 2 years in prison (September 2024) and Wang to time served (November 2024) in recognition of their cooperation with the government.[^8] Changpeng Zhao was separately sentenced to four months in April 2024 for unrelated Binance violations.[^3]

A debtors' report published on April 9, 2023 formally documented the management, governance, and security failures at FTX. By October 2024, a Delaware judge approved FTX's reorganization plan, under which approximately 98% of creditors were to receive around 119% of the value of their November 2022 claims — funded by the recovery of nearly \$16 billion in assets during the bankruptcy proceedings.[^9]

## Pre-Collapse Warning Signs

### 1. Overreliance on the FTT Token

Perhaps the most structurally significant red flag was the extent to which both FTX and Alameda Research's financial positions depended on FTT, a token that FTX itself had created. Alameda's balance sheet — later revealed by the CoinDesk report — showed approximately \$5.8 billion in FTT assets against \$9 billion in liabilities and only \$900 million in other assets.[^6] In a period of one week following the CoinDesk report, FTT's value collapsed from approximately \$5.9 billion to \$553 million.[^10]

This structure raised a fundamental question that was insufficiently examined: what would happen to FTX and Alameda's solvency if FTT's price declined significantly? Because FTX created FTT and Alameda held large quantities of it, both entities were exposed to the same circular risk. A decline in confidence in FTX would reduce the value of FTT, which would impair Alameda's balance sheet, which would further undermine confidence in FTX. This feedback loop was structurally embedded in the arrangement and visible — at least in outline — to any analyst who reviewed publicly available information about FTT's ownership distribution and Alameda's holdings.[^5][^10]

The FTT token's ownership was also heavily concentrated. FTX retained a large portion of the total FTT supply, and Alameda held most of the remainder, meaning there was limited genuine market liquidity to support the valuations recorded on Alameda's balance sheet. Critics have subsequently noted that this concentration — which is partially visible in on-chain token distribution data — should have raised questions about the reliability of any valuation based on prevailing market prices for a thinly traded asset.{/* NEEDS CITATION */}

### 2. Commingling of Customer Funds with Alameda Research

Investigators and post-collapse reporting revealed that FTX had routinely lent customer deposits to Alameda Research, enabling Alameda to make speculative investments and repay third-party lenders. This practice was entirely undisclosed to customers and amounted to treating retail customer funds as a source of corporate financing for a related-party hedge fund.[^1][^3]

The mechanism reportedly worked as follows: FTX granted Alameda a special and essentially unlimited credit line, secured in part by FTT holdings valued at above-market rates. When crypto prices declined sharply in May 2022 following the TerraUSD collapse, Alameda reportedly drew on this credit line — backed by customer funds — to meet its liabilities. The result was that by the time mass withdrawals began in November 2022, FTX did not have sufficient liquid assets to return customer funds, producing the reported \$8 billion shortfall.[^3][^6]

This arrangement was not disclosed in FTX's terms of service or public marketing materials. Standard regulated brokerage and banking frameworks in most jurisdictions explicitly prohibit such commingling — requiring customer assets to be held in segregated accounts — which is why the absence of regulatory oversight was a necessary precondition for this practice to continue undetected.[^5][^7]

### 3. Poor Governance and Internal Controls

The April 2023 debtors' report described in stark terms the governance vacuum at FTX. According to the report, the FTX Group "lacked appropriate management, governance and organizational structure."[^9] Specific security failures cited included private keys stored in unencrypted files, cryptocurrency assets held in internet-connected "hot" wallets, an absence of multifactor authentication in critical systems, and multiple individuals having unchecked access to accounts controlling billions of dollars in crypto assets.[^9][^5]

FTX used QuickBooks — accounting software designed for small businesses — to manage bookkeeping for an entity with a \$32 billion valuation.[^1] There was no proper audit under U.S. GAAP for FTX's 2021 financials, and the auditing firms that did review FTX's statements were later criticized by analysts and commentators for producing work that failed to identify the fundamental misrepresentations in FTX's accounts. Post-collapse commentary described this work as functioning more like endorsement than independent scrutiny — though the precise legal standard of care applicable to crypto entities, and the extent of auditor liability, remained matters of active legal dispute as of 2024.[^10]

The absence of a functioning board of directors or independent oversight committee was also notable given FTX's valuation and investor profile. Major institutional investors — including Sequoia Capital, which invested approximately \$215 million — conducted due diligence but apparently did not surface the related-party arrangements at the core of the fraud.[^6] Post-collapse, Sequoia wrote the investment down to zero and published an apology to its limited partners.[^2]

### 4. Lack of Regulatory Oversight

FTX was not a registered bank, brokerage, or regulated financial institution in most jurisdictions where it operated. This meant that customers who deposited assets with FTX had none of the legal protections available to bank depositors or brokerage clients — including deposit insurance, segregation requirements, or regulatory capital rules. FTX's terms of service explicitly disclaimed responsibility for losses resulting from hacks or cyberattacks, a clause that would have been impermissible for a regulated financial institution.[^5][^10]

Notably, FTX's U.S.-based subsidiary, LedgerX, which operated under regulatory oversight from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), survived the collapse intact — illustrating how regulatory frameworks can constrain or surface problems that destroyed the parent exchange.[^1] The contrast between LedgerX's survival and FTX International's collapse has been cited by policymakers arguing for extending CFTC or SEC oversight to crypto spot markets.[^7]

<EntityLink id="sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</EntityLink> was simultaneously lobbying Congress for cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks — specifically advocating for legislation that some critics argued would have entrenched large established players while placing compliance burdens on smaller competitors. The simultaneous nature of this lobbying and the underlying fraud has raised questions about whether regulatory engagement can serve as a credibility signal absent genuine regulatory accountability.[^1]

### 5. Opaque Business Model and Unstable Revenue Sources

FTX's primary revenue streams included fees on margin trading and leveraged tokens, as well as a mechanism for "burning" FTT tokens using approximately 33% of its revenues — a deflationary mechanism analogous in structure to stock buybacks, designed to reduce total FTT supply over time and thereby support FTT's price.[^5] This buyback-equivalent mechanism meant that FTX was effectively directing a substantial portion of its revenues to support the market value of its own token, creating incentives to sustain or inflate FTT's apparent value.

This revenue model was inherently dependent on high trading volumes in a buoyant market, and was particularly vulnerable to the kind of crypto market downturn that began in 2022. Rather than building a sustainable business on stable trading fee revenues largely independent of market conditions, FTX's financial model was tightly coupled to the performance of speculative crypto markets and the perceived value of its own token.

The FTT burning mechanism also gave large FTT holders — above all, Alameda — an additional structural incentive to avoid any action that might cause FTT's price to decline, reinforcing the conflict of interest between Alameda's role as a trading firm and its role as the largest external holder of an FTX-issued token.[^5]

### 6. Historical Precedents Ignored

The FTX model bore structural similarities to earlier crypto exchange failures that might have served as cautionary precedents. Mt. Gox, which collapsed in 2014 after hackers stole approximately 800,000 bitcoins, had similarly held customer funds in a shared "hot" wallet rather than in individually segregated accounts.[^5] The TerraUSD/Luna collapse in May 2022 — which destroyed approximately \$40 billion in market capitalization within days — and the subsequent bankruptcies of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital had already demonstrated the fragility of crypto entities that combined speculative asset positions with retail customer obligations.[^7][^6] Yet these precedents did not prompt the level of scrutiny of FTX that they arguably warranted, despite the structural similarities.

The speed of the TerraUSD collapse, in particular, was directly relevant to FTX's situation: it showed that a token whose value depended on maintained confidence could lose most of its value in days. The same dynamic applied to FTT, but this parallel was not publicly drawn by institutional investors or analysts in the months between the TerraUSD collapse and the CoinDesk report.

## Why the Red Flags Were Overlooked

Multiple factors contributed to the failure to act on these warning signs before FTX's collapse.

**Hype and reputational capital**: <EntityLink id="sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</EntityLink> had cultivated a carefully managed public image as a responsible, regulation-friendly crypto entrepreneur committed to effective altruism and large-scale philanthropy. His high profile made investors and journalists less likely to scrutinize FTX critically — a dynamic that several post-collapse analyses have described as a "halo effect."[^2][^5] His prominent donations, including pledges to the <EntityLink id="ftx-future-fund">FTX Future Fund</EntityLink> and to causes aligned with the <EntityLink id="cea">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>, amplified his credibility in influential communities where such philanthropic signaling carried significant social weight.

**Investor pressure during bull market**: The 2020–2021 crypto bull market created intense pressure on venture capital firms to secure stakes in fast-growing crypto exchanges. Major institutional investors — including Sequoia Capital, Paradigm, and SoftBank — invested hundreds of millions of dollars in FTX despite the warning signs that, in retrospect, should have been visible during due diligence. Many of these investors publicly acknowledged their due diligence failures after the collapse.[^6][^2] The speed at which investment rounds were closing — reportedly in some cases with minimal documentation review — has been cited as a structural feature of the 2021 venture environment that warrants reform.

**Regulatory vacuum**: Without bank-like regulatory requirements for fund segregation, capital adequacy, or third-party auditing under recognized standards, there was no formal mechanism that would have forced disclosure of the FTX-Alameda relationship or the commingling of customer funds.[^1][^5] The information asymmetry between FTX and its users and investors was substantial, and the existing regulatory framework did not close this gap. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago noted in its post-collapse analysis that the absence of run-prevention mechanisms — analogous to deposit insurance and reserve requirements — made crypto exchanges structurally vulnerable to confidence-driven bank-run dynamics.[^7]

**Bull market masking structural problems**: As academic analyses of the collapse have noted, had cryptocurrency prices continued to rise, the structural problems at FTX might have remained hidden indefinitely — because a rising FTT price would have kept Alameda's balance sheet nominally solvent and prevented any visible liquidity shortfall.[^2] The 2022 crypto market downturn — driven partly by rising interest rates and the TerraUSD collapse — removed this cover and accelerated the exposure of the underlying insolvency.

**Complexity and opacity of crypto balance sheets**: Unlike public companies subject to standardized financial reporting requirements, FTX was not required to publish audited financial statements in a format that would allow external analysts to identify the circular FTT-Alameda arrangement. The novelty and complexity of crypto balance sheets — combining on-chain assets, proprietary tokens, and off-chain liabilities — made independent analysis difficult even for sophisticated investors.[^9][^5]

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Auditor Failures

The auditing firms that reviewed FTX's financial statements have been criticized by analysts and commentators for failing to identify or report on fundamental misrepresentations in FTX's accounts. Post-collapse analysis described their work as having been inadequate for detecting the scale of the fraud — with some critics characterizing the resulting financial statements as having provided an unwarranted impression of legitimacy to investors and customers.[^10] This characterization has been disputed in legal proceedings, where questions of what standard of care applies to auditors of non-registered crypto entities remain actively contested.

The broader issue raised by the FTX auditor controversy is whether conventional auditing methods — designed for entities holding conventional financial assets — are adequate for crypto entities that hold large positions in their own proprietary tokens, where on-chain verification would be necessary to confirm actual asset existence and valuation. Post-collapse regulatory discussions in the U.S. and EU have included proposals to require crypto-specific audit standards that incorporate on-chain asset verification.[^7]

### Venture Capital Due Diligence

The willingness of sophisticated institutional investors to deploy large sums into FTX without apparent scrutiny of its related-party transactions or governance structure has drawn significant criticism. The suggestion that competitive pressure and market momentum overrode standard due diligence processes raises questions about risk management practices in the venture capital ecosystem during the 2021 crypto boom.[^6][^2] Several investors — including Sequoia Capital — published post-collapse statements acknowledging they had not detected the governance failures. The legal question of whether investors had actionable claims against FTX's management for material misrepresentations during fundraising was among the matters addressed in subsequent litigation.

### Regulatory Capture Concerns

<EntityLink id="sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</EntityLink> was actively engaged in lobbying for cryptocurrency regulation in Washington at the time of FTX's collapse — advocating for frameworks that some critics argued would have entrenched large established players like FTX while burdening smaller competitors. The simultaneous nature of this lobbying effort and the underlying fraud has raised questions about whether regulatory engagement can serve as a credibility signal in the absence of actual regulatory accountability.[^1] SBF's Washington presence and political donations — which were disclosed to be among the largest in the 2022 election cycle — have also been cited in discussions about campaign finance and regulatory access for financial industry participants.

### EA Community Fallout

The collapse had significant implications for the <EntityLink id="ftx-future-fund">FTX Future Fund</EntityLink> and the broader effective altruism community. <EntityLink id="sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</EntityLink> had been one of the most prominent donors to EA-aligned causes, and the Future Fund had been a major funder of organizations including those focused on AI risk and biosecurity, with ties to institutions including the <EntityLink id="fhi">Future of Humanity Institute</EntityLink>. After the collapse, grantees faced potential clawbacks of funds received from FTX-affiliated entities, and the EA community underwent substantial public scrutiny over its relationship with SBF and its institutional due diligence processes.[^8][^11]

The FTX collapse also prompted internal discussion within the EA community about whether the "earn to give" strategy — under which individuals pursue high-earning careers in finance or technology in order to donate large sums — creates incentive structures that are difficult to reconcile with the ethical commitments EA espouses. The <EntityLink id="80000-hours">80,000 Hours</EntityLink> organization, which had previously highlighted SBF as an exemplar of the earn-to-give model, updated its public guidance following the collapse.[^8]

The <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink> project — which had operated separately from FTX-affiliated funding — faced questions about whether the broader EA funding ecosystem had been adequately diversified and whether donor concentration around a small number of high-profile individuals created systemic fragility for the organizations that depended on EA-aligned funding.

## Key Uncertainties

- The precise extent to which individual investors or auditors had information sufficient to identify the fraud before November 2022, versus genuinely being deceived, remains contested in ongoing legal proceedings.
- The degree to which the FTX collapse reflected idiosyncratic fraud by SBF versus systemic vulnerabilities present across the crypto exchange sector is an open question, with implications for how regulatory reform should be designed.
- The long-term industry impact of post-FTX regulatory proposals — including calls for mandatory fund segregation, third-party auditing, and licensing requirements — remains to be determined as rulemaking proceeds in multiple jurisdictions.
- Whether the repayment of approximately 119% of creditor claims (in nominal dollar terms) represents genuine recovery is debated: Bitcoin prices rose substantially between the bankruptcy filing and the repayment period, meaning customers who held Bitcoin on FTX received dollar-equivalent value that is significantly lower than what they would have held had their Bitcoin remained in their possession.
- The extent of auditor liability under applicable professional standards is being determined in civil litigation, with outcomes likely to influence future audit standards for crypto entities.
- Whether SBF's effective altruism commitments were genuine but poorly implemented, or were primarily reputational strategy, has been a subject of significant debate within and outside the EA community, with implications for how philanthropic credentialing should be weighted in evaluating financial counterparties.[^8]
