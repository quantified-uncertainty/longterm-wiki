## Overview

The FTX collapse refers to the rapid and catastrophic failure of FTX, once the third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11, 2022. Founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (widely known as SBF), FTX had been valued at \$32 billion at its peak and served over one million users.[^1] The collapse revealed that approximately \$8.9 billion in customer funds had been misappropriated, secretly transferred to FTX's affiliated trading firm Alameda Research to cover losses and fund high-risk investments.[^2] John Ray III, appointed as replacement CEO and previously known for overseeing the Enron bankruptcy, described the situation as an unprecedented failure of corporate controls across his entire career.[^3]

The event carried significant consequences beyond the cryptocurrency sector. Sam Bankman-Fried had been one of the most prominent public advocates for <EntityLink id="E517">effective altruism</EntityLink> (EA), the philosophical and philanthropic movement centered on maximizing positive impact through evidence-based giving. Through the <EntityLink id="E855">FTX Future Fund</EntityLink> and personal donations, SBF had channeled substantial resources into EA-aligned causes including AI safety research. His fraud conviction therefore did not merely damage his personal reputation—it called into question the judgment, vetting standards, and moral authority of the EA movement as a whole. Internal EA community surveys conducted after the collapse found measurable declines in trust toward EA leadership and institutions, prompting significant internal debate about the movement's direction and culture.

## The FTX Collapse: Timeline and Causes

### Origins of the Crisis

FTX's downfall was precipitated by a structural vulnerability that had existed throughout its operation: the exchange's deep financial entanglement with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency trading firm also founded by Bankman-Fried. Both entities relied heavily on FTT, a token created and issued by FTX itself, which formed a significant portion of Alameda's balance sheet. Because FTT could not be easily converted to cash, Alameda's apparent financial strength was largely illusory—contingent on the market value of a token FTX itself controlled.[^4]

On November 2, 2022, the news outlet CoinDesk published an article exposing the extent of Alameda's reliance on FTT, raising immediate concerns about whether FTX's reserves were adequate.[^4] The report spread rapidly, sowing doubt among traders and investors about FTX's underlying solvency.

### The Bank Run and Bankruptcy

The situation escalated sharply on November 6, 2022, when Changpeng Zhao, CEO of rival exchange Binance, publicly announced that Binance would liquidate its FTT holdings, then valued at approximately \$580 million.[^4] This announcement triggered a bank-run-like surge in withdrawal requests that FTX was unable to meet. The exchange halted customer withdrawals due to insufficient liquid funds.[^5]

On November 8, Binance briefly announced a nonbinding letter of intent to acquire FTX, citing a significant liquidity crunch. However, after reviewing FTX's financial records during due diligence, Binance withdrew from the deal on November 9, stating that the issues it found were beyond its ability to address.[^6] Bitcoin prices fell an additional 14% following the announcement of Binance's withdrawal. The crypto lender BlockFi, which had significant exposure to FTX, announced on November 10 that it was pausing client withdrawals.

FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11, 2022, along with Alameda Research and over 130 affiliated entities.[^1] Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO and was replaced by John Ray III. Within days, the Wall Street Journal reported that FTX had secretly lent customer deposits to Alameda Research to help cover its liabilities—a practice that constituted the core of what prosecutors would later call one of the largest financial frauds in American history.[^5] Federal prosecutors in New York launched an investigation on November 14.

### Financial Scope

The bankruptcy proceedings uncovered an \$8.9 billion shortfall between what FTX owed customers and the assets available to repay them.[^7] Bankman-Fried had secretly transferred approximately \$10 billion in customer funds to Alameda, with at least \$1 billion disappearing entirely and \$4.1 billion tied to loans involving related parties, including \$1 billion lent to Bankman-Fried personally.[^3] An additional \$473 million was taken from FTX in an unauthorized transaction following the collapse.[^8] The proceedings listed over 100,000 creditors and assets and liabilities each estimated in the \$10–50 billion range.[^9]

### Legal Consequences

Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud on November 2, 2023, following testimony from former FTX and Alameda executives Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh, who pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors.[^5] On March 28, 2024, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.[^6] Changpeng Zhao of Binance was separately sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for allowing criminals to use the Binance platform for money laundering.[^6]

On the recovery side, a U.S. District Court ordered FTX to pay \$12.7 billion in relief to customers in August 2024, comprising \$8.7 billion in restitution and \$4 billion in disgorgement.[^7] In October 2024, a Delaware bankruptcy judge approved FTX's reorganization plan, with 98% of creditors set to receive approximately 119% of the dollar value of their November 2022 claims, funded by assets recovered during bankruptcy proceedings.[^7] Repayments to customers with smaller claims began in early 2025 through partnerships with Kraken and BitGo.[^7]

## Effective Altruism: Background and SBF's Role

Effective altruism is a philosophical and social movement that advocates for using evidence and careful reasoning to identify the highest-impact ways to benefit others. It has historically focused on causes including global health, animal welfare, and—increasingly in the years before the FTX collapse—long-term risks from advanced artificial intelligence. The movement encompasses a range of institutions including <EntityLink id="E510">80,000 Hours</EntityLink>, the <EntityLink id="E517">Centre for Effective Altruism</EntityLink>, and <EntityLink id="E552">Open Philanthropy</EntityLink>, as well as associated research centers and community hubs at universities worldwide.

Sam Bankman-Fried had become one of EA's most prominent public figures. He publicly described his strategy of pursuing a high-earning career in finance or crypto in order to donate large sums to effective causes—a practice the EA community calls "earning to give." He pledged to donate the majority of his wealth and positioned FTX's profits as the engine for a large-scale philanthropic program. The <EntityLink id="E855">FTX Future Fund</EntityLink>, launched in 2022, made grants to dozens of EA-aligned organizations, including several working on AI safety.[^10]

This profile made SBF something of a flagship example for the EA movement—proof that its principles could be operationalized at scale by ambitious individuals in high-finance careers. When the fraud was revealed, that association became deeply damaging.

## Impact on EA's Public Credibility

### Internal Trust and Community Sentiment

Community surveys conducted in the aftermath of the collapse found concrete, measurable damage to trust within the EA movement. According to data from EA community research, satisfaction with EA as a whole declined by approximately 0.5 to 1 point on a 10-point scale, settling at around 7.5/10.[^10] Roughly 30% of survey respondents reported that they had substantially lost trust in EA public figures or leadership as a result of the crisis.[^10] Around half of respondents expressed concerns specifically about EA meta-organizations, community norms, and how leadership had handled its relationship with Bankman-Fried.[^10]

Importantly, the general public and students in university EA groups appeared largely unaffected—awareness of EA's specific connection to SBF was not widespread outside the community itself. The damage was most concentrated among those already engaged with EA, for whom the collapse represented a significant internal credibility shock.[^10]

### Moral Authority and Intellectual Legitimacy

According to community observers, one of EA's most significant losses was in the domain of moral authority. The movement had built a public identity around rigorous ethical reasoning, transparency, and the idea that its institutions and endorsements were unusually well-vetted. The prominence of Bankman-Fried as a celebrated EA figure—and the failure of EA institutions to identify or act on warning signs—undermined those claims.

Critics argued that EA concepts like utilitarian expected-value reasoning and earning-to-give may have provided ideological cover for Bankman-Fried's risk-taking and fraud, though this remains contested within the community.[^10] Others noted that the association between ambitious young EAs and high-finance careers created structural incentives that were difficult to reconcile with the movement's ethical aspirations.

### Financial Consequences for EA Organizations

The FTX Future Fund had become a significant funding source for EA institutions and adjacent projects. Its collapse threatened ongoing grants and created uncertainty about future funding streams.[^10] There were also concerns about potential clawbacks of funds already distributed to EA organizations, though EA institutions themselves were considered unlikely to face existential financial risk—the movement's broader financial position was expected to revert roughly to what it had been before FTX's rise.[^10]

The loss of a major funder nonetheless represented a real contraction in EA's capacity to fund new projects, particularly in areas like AI safety research that had benefited significantly from FTX-linked philanthropy.

## Criticisms and Concerns

### Failure of Vetting and Due Diligence

A central criticism directed at EA leadership following the collapse was that the community had failed to adequately scrutinize Bankman-Fried despite warning signs. EA institutions and prominent figures had endorsed, celebrated, and directed grant funding through SBF and the FTX Future Fund without sufficient independent verification of how FTX operated or whether its financial practices were sound. Critics argued this reflected a broader cultural tendency in EA toward deference to high-status individuals and toward optimistic assumptions about the ethical commitments of major donors.[^10]

### Utilitarian Rationalization

Some critics, both inside and outside EA, argued that the movement's philosophical commitments—particularly a form of consequentialism that evaluates actions entirely by their outcomes—made it vulnerable to the kind of reasoning Bankman-Fried reportedly used to justify his actions. The argument that doing enough good downstream could justify fraud upstream was characterized by critics as a foreseeable pathology of EA's ethical framework, not merely an individual aberration.[^10]

### Governance and Accountability Structures

The collapse raised questions about whether EA's institutional structures were adequate to provide meaningful accountability for the large sums of money the movement had come to control. Critics noted that the same networks of personal trust and ideological alignment that enabled rapid funding also made it difficult to challenge or scrutinize prominent figures within the community.[^10]

### Defenses and Counter-Arguments

Some within the EA community and sympathetic observers argued that Bankman-Fried's fraud represented an individual act of criminality rather than a systematic failure of EA as a philosophy or institution. From this perspective, the appropriate response was to strengthen governance and vetting procedures rather than to conclude that EA's core intellectual commitments were flawed. Others noted that post-collapse speculation about external political motivations was unsupported by evidence; the bankruptcy was triggered by identifiable financial mismanagement and fraud, as documented through the federal prosecution and bankruptcy proceedings.

There was also some acknowledgment that the reputational damage, while real, might produce positive reforms: reduced deference to charismatic leaders, stronger institutional accountability, and more rigorous separation between EA philosophy and the financial activities of individuals who identify with the movement.[^10]

## Key Uncertainties

- The long-term effect of the FTX collapse on EA's overall growth trajectory and ability to recruit talented individuals remains unclear. Short-term surveys show internal trust damage, but sustained longitudinal data is limited.
- The extent to which EA's philosophical framework, as opposed to individual failure or inadequate governance, was causally implicated in the fraud is genuinely contested and has not been resolved.
- The degree to which AI safety research funding was durably set back by the loss of FTX-linked philanthropy is difficult to assess, given subsequent growth in funding from other sources.
- Public awareness of EA's specific association with SBF appears low outside the community, meaning the reputational damage may be more concentrated among educated, engaged audiences than it is diffuse across the general public.
