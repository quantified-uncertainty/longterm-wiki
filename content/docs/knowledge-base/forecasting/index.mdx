## Overview

This section compiles forecasts about AI development trajectories, capability timelines, and safety outcomes. Tracking predictions over time helps calibrate expectations and identify who has good track records.

## Forecast Categories

### <EntityLink id="agi-development">AGI Development</EntityLink>
When might transformative AI arrive?
- Expert surveys and estimates
- Compute-based projections
- Historical accuracy of past forecasts

### <EntityLink id="agi-timeline">AGI Timeline</EntityLink>
Detailed timeline predictions:
- 2025-2030 scenarios
- 2030-2040 scenarios
- Post-2040 considerations

## Key Forecast Sources

| Source | Focus | Method | Track Record |
|--------|-------|--------|--------------|
| <EntityLink id="E199">Metaculus</EntityLink> | AI milestones | Prediction market | Good calibration |
| <EntityLink id="E125">Epoch AI</EntityLink> | Compute trends | Trend extrapolation | Strong on hardware |
| Expert surveys | Timeline estimates | Elicitation | Variable |
| Superforecasters | Specific questions | Tournament forecasting | Best overall |

## Current Consensus Ranges

| Question | Low | Median | High |
|----------|-----|--------|------|
| P(AGI by 2030) | 10% | 25% | 50% |
| P(AGI by 2040) | 40% | 65% | 85% |
| P(Catastrophe | AGI) | 5% | 15% | 40% |

*Estimates represent rough synthesis of public expert views; wide disagreement exists.*

## Forecasting Best Practices

- **Track calibration** - Did predictions come true at stated probabilities?
- **Decompose questions** - Break complex questions into more tractable components
- **Update regularly** - Revise forecasts as new information arrives
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** - Use ranges, not point estimates
