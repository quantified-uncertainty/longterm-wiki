## Overview

By 2040, humanity may access most knowledge through just 2-3 dominant AI systems, fundamentally altering how we understand truth and reality. Current market dynamics show accelerating concentration: training a frontier model costs over \$100M and requires massive datasets that favor incumbents. Google processes 8.5 billion searches daily, while ChatGPT reached 100 million users in 2 months—establishing unprecedented information bottlenecks.

This trajectory threatens <EntityLink id="E123">epistemic security</EntityLink> through correlated errors (when all AIs share the same mistakes), knowledge capture (when dominant systems embed particular interests), and feedback loops where AI-generated content trains future AI. Unlike traditional media monopolies, AI knowledge monopolies could shape not just what information we access, but how we think about reality itself.

Research indicates we're already in Phase 2 of concentration (2025-2030), with 3-5 viable frontier AI companies remaining as training costs exclude smaller players and open-source alternatives fall behind.
