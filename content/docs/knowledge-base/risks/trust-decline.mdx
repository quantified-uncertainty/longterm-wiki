title: AI-Driven Trust Decline
description: The systematic decline in public confidence in institutions, media, and verification systems—accelerated by AI's capacity to fabricate evidence and exploit epistemic vulnerabilities. US government trust has fallen from 73% (1958) to 17% (2025), with AI-generated deepfakes projected to reach 8 million by 2025.

llmSummary: US government trust declined from 73% (1958) to 17% (2025), with AI deepfakes projected to reach 8M by 2025 accelerating erosion through the 'liar's dividend' effect—where synthetic content possibility undermines all evidence. Media literacy interventions show d=0.60 effect size, while C2PA content authentication provides medium-high promise for verification, though adoption rates remain uncertain (10-60% by 2027).

## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Current Trust Level** | Critical (17-22% federal government trust) | [Pew Research Center 2025](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/12/04/public-trust-in-government-1958-2025/): down from 73% in 1958 |
| **Decline Rate** | Accelerating | 55-point drop since 1958; 5-point decline 2024→2025 alone |
| **AI Acceleration** | High | 500K deepfake videos shared on social media in 2023, projected 8M by 2025 |
| **Coordination Impact** | Severe | Only 34% trust government to use AI responsibly ([Edelman 2025](https://www.edelman.com/trust/2025/trust-barometer)) |
| **Reversibility** | Low (decades) | Trust rebuilding requires sustained institutional reform over 10-20+ years |
| **Intervention Readiness** | Medium | C2PA standard gaining traction; media literacy shows d=0.60 effect size |
| **Cross-Domain Risk** | High | Trust collapse undermines pandemic response, climate action, <EntityLink id="E608">AI governance</EntityLink> |

## Overview

Trust erosion describes the **active process** of declining public confidence in institutions, experts, media, and verification systems. While the current *state* of societal trust is analyzed in the <EntityLink id="E285">Societal Trust</EntityLink> parameter page, this page focuses on trust erosion as a **risk**—examining the threat model, acceleration mechanisms, and responses.

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Severity** | High | Undermines democratic governance, collective action on existential risks |
| **Likelihood** | Very High | Already occurring; AI accelerating pre-existing trends |
| **Timeline** | Ongoing | Effects visible now, intensifying over 2-5 years |
| **Trend** | Accelerating | AI content generation scaling faster than verification capacity |
| **Reversibility** | Difficult | Rebuilding trust requires sustained effort over decades |

---

## Why Trust Erosion Is a Risk

Trust erosion threatens AI safety and existential risk response through several mechanisms:

| Domain | Impact | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **AI Governance** | Regulatory resistance, lab-government distrust | Only ≈40% trust government to regulate AI appropriately (OECD 2024) |
| **Elections** | Contested results, violence | 4 in 10 with high grievance approve hostile activism (<R id="1312df71e6a1ca40">Edelman 2025</R>) |
| **Public Health** | Pandemic response failure | Healthcare trust dropped 30.4 pts during COVID-19 |
| **Climate Action** | Policy paralysis | Only ≈40% believe government will reduce emissions effectively |
| **International Cooperation** | Treaty verification failures | Liar's dividend undermines evidence-based agreements |

The core dynamic: **low trust prevents the coordination needed to address catastrophic risks**, while AI capabilities make trust harder to maintain.

## Historical Trust Trajectory

Trust erosion is not new, but AI capabilities threaten to accelerate existing trends dramatically:

| Period | US Government Trust | Key Driver | AI Relevance |
|--------|---------------------|------------|--------------|
| 1958-1964 | 73-77% | Post-WWII institutional confidence | None |
| 1965-1980 | 77% → 26% | Vietnam War, Watergate | None |
| 1980-2000 | 26-44% | Economic growth, Cold War end | None |
| 2001-2008 | 25-49% | 9/11 rally, Iraq War decline | Early internet |
| 2009-2020 | 17-24% | Financial crisis, polarization | Social media amplification |
| 2021-2025 | 17-22% | Pandemic, election disputes, AI content | **Deepfakes, LLM misinformation** |

## The AI Acceleration Factor

AI capabilities are fundamentally changing the trust erosion dynamic through several mechanisms:

### Scale Asymmetry

The volume of synthetic content is growing exponentially:
- **2023**: 500,000+ deepfake videos shared on social media
- **2025 projection**: 8 million deepfake videos
- **Daily AI image generation**: 34 million images/day via tools like DALL-E, Midjourney
- **Total since 2022**: Over 15 billion AI-generated images created

This creates a fundamental asymmetry: misinformation can be produced faster than it can be verified, and the mere possibility of synthetic content undermines trust in authentic content ([Atlantic Council Digital Forensics Lab](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/trust-conference-2024-six-things-we-learnt-about-impact-ai-misinformation-and-news-business)).

### Mass-Class Digital Divide

The [2025 Edelman Trust Barometer](https://www.edelman.com/trust/2025/trust-barometer) reveals a significant trust gap:
- **71% of UK bottom income quartile** feel they will be "left behind" by AI
- **65% of US bottom income quartile** share this concern
- Only **1 in 4 non-managers** regularly use AI vs. **2 in 3 managers**

This creates a two-tier information environment where those with AI literacy can navigate synthetic content while others cannot, exacerbating existing inequality and trust divides.

## Key Acceleration Mechanism: The Liar's Dividend

The most concerning AI-driven dynamic is the **liar's dividend** (<R id="ad6fe8bb9c2db0d9">Chesney & Citron</R>): the mere *possibility* of fabricated evidence undermines trust in *all* evidence.

### Research Findings

A landmark study published in the [American Political Science Review (February 2025)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/liars-dividend-can-politicians-claim-misinformation-to-evade-accountability/687FEE54DBD7ED0C96D72B26606AA073) by Schiff, Schiff, and Bueno administered five survey experiments to over 15,000 American adults:

| Finding | Effect | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Politicians claiming "fake news" | Higher support than apologizing | Incentivizes denialism |
| Effect crosses party lines | Both parties' supporters susceptible | Not limited to polarized base |
| Text vs. video evidence | Liar's dividend works for text, **not video** | Video still retains credibility |
| Mechanism | Informational uncertainty + oppositional rallying | Two distinct pathways |

**Key insight**: The effect operates through two channels—creating informational uncertainty ("maybe it really is fake") and rallying supporters against perceived media attacks. Both strategies work independently.

### Real-World Examples

| Case | Year | Impact |
|------|------|--------|
| Slovakia election deepfake | 2023 | Fake audio of opposition leader discussing election rigging went viral days before election |
| Gabon coup attempt | 2019 | Claims that president's video was deepfake helped spur military coup attempt |
| Turkey election withdrawal | 2023 | Presidential candidate withdrew after explicit AI-generated videos spread |
| UK Keir Starmer audio | 2024 | Deepfake audio spread rapidly before being exposed as fabrication |

This creates a double bind where neither belief nor disbelief in evidence can be rationally justified—and the effect will intensify as deepfake capabilities improve. According to a [YouGov survey](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/deepfakes-elections-and-shrinking-liars-dividend), **85% of Americans** are "very" or "somewhat" concerned about misleading deepfakes.

## Key Uncertainties

| Uncertainty | Range | Implications |
|-------------|-------|--------------|
| **Content authentication adoption rate** | 10-60% of major platforms by 2027 | High adoption could restore verification; low adoption means continued erosion |
| **AI detection keeping pace** | 40-80% detection accuracy | Determines whether technical defenses remain viable |
| **Trust recovery timeline** | 10-30+ years | Shapes whether coordination for long-term risks is achievable |
| **Generational divergence** | 18-34: 59% AI trust vs. 55+: 18% (UK) | May resolve naturally or create permanent trust gap |
| **Institutional reform success** | Unknown | Trust rebuilding requires demonstrable competence over sustained period |

### Crux Questions

1. **Can content authentication scale?** The [C2PA standard](https://c2pa.org/) provides a technical solution, but adoption requires coordination across platforms, media organizations, and hardware manufacturers. If adoption reaches critical mass (estimated 40-60% of content), the liar's dividend may shrink.

2. **Will AI detection capabilities keep pace with generation?** Currently, detection lags generation by 6-18 months. If this gap widens, technical verification becomes impossible; if it narrows, authentication systems become viable.

3. **Does media literacy scale?** Individual interventions show d=0.60 effect size, but effects decay over time ([PNAS study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1920498117)). Requires recurring reinforcement rather than one-time training.
