**Superintelligence** refers to any intellect that greatly exceeds human cognitive performance across virtually all domains of interest.[^1] The concept encompasses hypothetical AI systems that would surpass human-level intelligence not just in narrow tasks, but in general reasoning, creativity, social intelligence, and other cognitive capabilities.

## Definition and Forms

Nick Bostrom's 2014 book *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies* established the most widely-used taxonomy, identifying three distinct forms:[^2]

**Speed superintelligence** describes a system with cognitive capabilities similar to human minds but operating at significantly faster speeds. Such a system could accomplish in minutes what would take humans months or years. Speed superintelligence could arise from whole brain emulations running on faster hardware substrates.

**Collective superintelligence** consists of multiple intellects coordinating and communicating to achieve capabilities far exceeding any individual intelligence. This form excels at parallelizable tasks. Current examples include prediction markets and research organizations, though at levels far below what would constitute superintelligence.

**Quality superintelligence** refers to systems that are qualitatively smarter than humans—capable of intellectual tasks that humans cannot perform regardless of time allocation. This form would represent fundamentally different and superior cognitive architectures.

## Historical Development

The core concept predates modern AI research. In 1965, mathematician I. J. Good published "Speculations Concerning the First Ultraintelligent Machine," defining an ultraintelligent machine as one "that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever."[^3] Good noted that "the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities; therefore, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines," introducing the concept of recursive self-improvement.[^4]

The term "superintelligence" gained broader attention following Bostrom's 2014 book, which systematically analyzed potential development paths, capabilities, and control challenges. The book received mixed reception—while influential in AI safety circles, some critics characterized it as "speculations built upon plausible conjecture."[^5] Other researchers noted that sophisticated machines remain "intelligent in only a limited sense" relative to human general intelligence.[^6]

## Paths to Development

### Recursive Self-Improvement

<EntityLink id="E291">Recursive self-improvement</EntityLink> (RSI) describes a process where an AI system modifies its own code to enhance its capabilities, which then enables it to make further improvements, potentially leading to rapid capability gains.[^7] This mechanism forms the basis of intelligence explosion theories.

Current research includes Meta AI's work on self-modifying systems and Google DeepMind's AlphaEvolve, though these remain far from the recursive self-improvement envisioned in superintelligence scenarios.[^8] In December 2025, <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink> co-founder Jared Kaplan described recursive self-improvement as the "ultimate risk" in AI development.[^9]

### Other Development Paths

Beyond recursive self-improvement, potential paths to superintelligence include:

- **AI development**: Continued advances in machine learning architectures and training methods
- **Whole brain emulation**: Detailed scanning and simulation of human brain structures
- **Biological cognitive enhancement**: Genetic or pharmaceutical improvements to human intelligence
- **Brain-computer interfaces**: Direct integration of human cognition with computational systems
- **Collective intelligence amplification**: Improved coordination mechanisms for human organizations

## Intelligence Explosion

The intelligence explosion hypothesis, articulated by <EntityLink id="E114">Eliezer Yudkowsky</EntityLink> and others, posits that "due to recursive self-improvement, an AI can potentially grow in capability on a timescale that seems fast relative to human experience."[^10] This relates directly to debates about takeoff speed.

**Fast takeoff** scenarios envision transitions from human-level to far-beyond-human capability occurring in hours, days, or weeks. Such rapid development would leave minimal time for human intervention or course correction.

**Slow takeoff** scenarios describe capability increases occurring over years or decades, allowing society to adapt gradually to changing AI capabilities. In 2021, <EntityLink id="E114">Eliezer Yudkowsky</EntityLink> and <EntityLink id="E220">Paul Christiano</EntityLink> debated the likelihood of these scenarios, with Yudkowsky arguing for discontinuous acceleration and Christiano favoring more gradual development.[^11]

The 2025 AI Index Report documents rapid capability improvements in specific domains—AI systems increased from solving 4.4% of coding problems in 2023 to 71.7% in 2024 on SWE-bench.[^12] However, on newly designed challenging benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, top systems score just 8.80%, suggesting substantial distance from human-level general intelligence.[^13]

## Theoretical Concepts

### Orthogonality Thesis

The orthogonality thesis, formulated by Bostrom, states that intelligence and final goals are orthogonal axes along which artificial intellects can vary independently.[^14] A system could possess any level of intelligence combined with essentially any set of final goals. This challenges assumptions that sufficiently intelligent systems would necessarily converge on particular values or objectives.

### Instrumental Convergence

The instrumental convergence thesis posits that agents with sufficient intelligence and diverse final goals will pursue similar intermediate strategies.[^15] These convergent instrumental goals potentially include:

- Self-preservation (to continue pursuing final goals)
- Goal-content integrity (maintaining original objectives)
- Cognitive enhancement (improving decision-making capabilities)
- Resource acquisition (obtaining means to achieve objectives)

These convergent goals raise control concerns, as they might motivate systems to resist shutdown or modification attempts regardless of their specified final objectives.

## Control Problem

The control problem addresses the challenge of ensuring superintelligent systems remain aligned with human values and under human oversight. As <EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink> stated in their 2023 superalignment announcement, "we don't have a solution for steering or controlling potentially superintelligent AI" and "current alignment techniques won't scale to superintelligence because humans won't be able to reliably supervise systems much smarter than us."[^16]

Three core challenges complicate superintelligence control:[^17]

**Value loading** involves specifying complex human values in a form that AI systems can understand and optimize. Human values prove difficult to formalize comprehensively.

**The interpretability gap** describes how superintelligent systems' internal reasoning may become incomprehensible to human overseers, making it difficult to verify alignment.

**Instrumental convergence** creates incentives for even well-intentioned systems to resist control measures that might interfere with goal achievement.

Researcher Joe Carlsmith identifies the availability of superhuman strategies—approaches to achieving goals that humans could neither generate nor detect—as a key obstacle to maintaining control.[^18]

## Strategic Implications

### Decisive Strategic Advantage

A "decisive strategic advantage" occurs when one project achieves sufficient capability superiority to overcome all opposition and achieve global dominance.[^19] Factors affecting this possibility include:

- **Takeoff speed**: Faster capability gains provide less time for competitors to catch up
- **Technology diffusion rates**: How quickly advances spread to other projects
- **Lead magnitude**: The initial capability gap between leading and following projects

### Singleton Scenarios

Bostrom defines a "singleton" as "a single global decision-making agency strong enough to solve all major global coordination problems."[^20] A superintelligent system with decisive strategic advantage might establish singleton control, though this depends on both capability gaps and whether such advantage would be used for global coordination.

Research suggests that even with gradual AI development (slow takeoff), decisive strategic advantage remains possible after intelligence explosion, as a superintelligent system could leverage qualitative cognitive advantages beyond simple speed increases.[^21]

## Expert Timelines and Forecasts

<EntityLink id="E125">Epoch AI</EntityLink> and AI Impacts have conducted multiple surveys of machine learning researchers regarding timelines for human-level AI:

**2022 Survey**: Surveyed machine learning researchers predicted a 50% probability of high-level machine intelligence (HLMI) by 2059—an aggregate forecast of 37 years from the survey date.[^22]

**2023 Survey**: A survey of 2,778 AI researchers in October 2023 reexamined questions from previous surveys regarding timelines for HLMI and full automation of labor.[^23]

A 2012 survey by Vincent Müller and Bostrom at the <EntityLink id="E140">Future of Humanity Institute</EntityLink> found that experts expect systems to move to superintelligence in less than 30 years after achieving human-level AI.[^24] Multiple earlier surveys through 2016 produced median 50% probability estimates for human-level AI ranging between 2035 and 2050.[^25]

## Current Capabilities Comparison

The 2025 AI Index Report documents areas where AI systems approach or exceed human performance:[^26]

- Reading comprehension benchmarks show near-human or exceeding performance
- Image classification matches or exceeds human accuracy in many domains
- Competition-level mathematics problems are increasingly solvable by AI systems

However, performance varies significantly by task type and time constraints. On short time horizons (two-hour budgets), top AI systems score four times higher than human experts on certain tasks. As time increases to 32 hours, human performance surpasses AI by a ratio of two to one, suggesting current systems lack robust general reasoning capabilities.[^27]

<EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink>'s GDPval benchmark, measuring performance on real-world tasks, found that Claude Opus 4.1 produces outputs as good as or better than humans in just under half of tested tasks, and that GPT-5 performance more than tripled in one year compared to GPT-4o.[^28]

## Governance Proposals

<EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink> has called for governance frameworks for superintelligence development, suggesting that major governments could establish coordinated projects or collectively agree to limit the rate of capability growth at the frontier.[^29]

In 2023, OpenAI cofounders proposed an "IAEA for superintelligence efforts" to govern high-capability systems.[^30] Carnegie Endowment research suggests that rather than a single institutional solution, governance will likely emerge as a regime complex with four functional categories:[^31]

1. Knowledge sharing among developers and governments
2. Norms and standards for development practices
3. Equitable access to AI benefits
4. Collective security mechanisms

The Future of Life Institute organized a statement calling for a global moratorium on superintelligence development until broad scientific consensus exists that it can be developed safely. The statement gathered over 133,000 signatories.[^32] As of October 2025, the UK government was considering plans for an international moratorium on superintelligent AI development.[^33]

## Alternative Perspectives

Eric Drexler's 2018 presentation at EA Global proposed Comprehensive AI Services (CAIS) as an alternative framework to monolithic superintelligence scenarios. CAIS envisions AI capabilities developing as specialized services rather than unified agents.[^34]

Some researchers argue that what is characterized as "superintelligence" actually describes "super-equipped intelligence"—systems with the same cognitive architecture as current AI but with greater resources and faster execution, rather than qualitatively superior intelligence.[^35]

Multiple deep learning researchers, including Andrew Ng, have compared concerns about superintelligence to "worrying about overpopulation on Mars," suggesting that current evidence does not support near-term superintelligence scenarios.[^36] Critics note that most writing on AI existential risks comes from a small number of sources, primarily Bostrom's *Superintelligence* and essays by Yudkowsky, with limited substantive criticism published.[^37]

Some colleagues of Bostrom have argued that nuclear war, nanotechnology, and biotechnology present more immediate and tractable threats than superintelligence.[^38]
