## Overview

Deepfakes are AI-generated synthetic media—typically video or audio—that realistically depict people saying or doing things they never did. The technology has evolved from obviously artificial content in 2017 to nearly indistinguishable synthetic media by 2024, creating both direct harms through fraud and harassment and systemic harms by eroding trust in authentic evidence.

High-profile fraud cases demonstrate the financial risks: a \$15.6 million theft at <R id="47f3128e5e7568af">Arup Hong Kong</R> involved an entire video conference of deepfaked executives, while a \$35 million case used voice cloning to impersonate company directors. Beyond individual crimes, deepfakes create a "liar's dividend" where authentic evidence becomes deniable, threatening democratic discourse and justice systems.

## Technical Capabilities & Development

### Current Generation Quality

| Capability | 2017 | 2024 | Evidence |
|------------|------|------|---------|
| Face Swapping | Obvious artifacts | Near-perfect quality | <R id="ac49b80df960f905">FaceSwap benchmarks</R> |
| Voice Cloning | Minutes of training data | 3-10 seconds needed | <R id="5a71dcde353b55d6">ElevenLabs</R>, <R id="0727e48c90269b22">Microsoft VALL-E</R> |
| Real-time Generation | Impossible | Live video calls | <R id="889388dfe364a550">DeepFaceLive</R> |
| Detection Resistance | Easily caught | Specialized tools required | <R id="0137bd3f0cb36015">DFDC Challenge results</R> |

### Key Technical Advances

**Real-time Generation**: Modern deepfake tools can generate synthetic faces during live video calls, enabling new forms of impersonation fraud. <R id="889388dfe364a550">DeepFaceLive</R> and similar tools require only consumer-grade GPUs.

**Few-shot Voice Cloning**: Services like <R id="5a71dcde353b55d6">ElevenLabs</R> can clone voices from seconds of audio. <R id="0727e48c90269b22">Microsoft's VALL-E</R> demonstrates even more sophisticated capabilities.

**<EntityLink id="adversarial-training">Adversarial Training</EntityLink>**: Modern generators specifically train to evade detection systems, creating an arms race where detection lags behind generation quality.

## Categories of Harm & Impact

### Financial Fraud

| Case | Amount | Method | Year | Source |
|------|--------|--------|------|--------|
| Arup Hong Kong | \$25.6M | Video conference deepfakes | 2024 | <R id="47f3128e5e7568af">CNN</R> |
| Hong Kong Company | \$35M | Voice cloning | 2020 | <R id="69a69fcb0c471689">Forbes</R> |
| WPP (Attempted) | Unknown | Multi-platform approach | 2024 | <R id="285ad0533234d867">BBC</R> |
| Elderly Crypto Scam | \$690K | <EntityLink id="elon-musk">Elon Musk</EntityLink> impersonation | 2024 | <R id="aa0b2348f388763a">NBC</R> |

**Emerging Patterns**:
- Multi-platform attacks combining voice, video, and messaging
- Targeting of elderly populations with celebrity impersonations
- Corporate fraud using executive impersonation
- Real-time video call deception

### Non-consensual Intimate Imagery

<R id="76caf48d6525d816">Sensity AI research</R> found that 90-95% of deepfake videos online are non-consensual intimate imagery, primarily targeting women. This creates:

- Psychological trauma and reputational harm
- Economic impacts through career damage
- Chilling effects on public participation
- Disproportionate gender-based violence

### Political Manipulation & The Liar's Dividend

Beyond creating false content, deepfakes enable the "liar's dividend"—authentic evidence becomes deniable. Political examples include:

- <R id="e12caaa5097b4d9b">Politicians claiming real recordings are deepfakes</R>
- Pre-emptive deepfake denials before scandals break
- Erosion of shared epistemic foundations

This links to broader epistemic risks and <EntityLink id="trust-cascade">trust cascade</EntityLink> patterns.
