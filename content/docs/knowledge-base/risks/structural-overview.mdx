## Overview

Structural risks are systemic harms that emerge from the interaction of AI systems with economic, political, and social structures. Unlike accident risks (where individual AI systems malfunction) or misuse risks (where humans deliberately weaponize AI), structural risks arise from the aggregate effects of AI deployment on societal organization. Many structural risks involve dynamics that are difficult to reverse once established, making early intervention particularly important.

## Power Concentration

Risks from AI enabling or accelerating the concentration of power:

- **<EntityLink id="E68">Concentration of Power</EntityLink>**: AI capabilities accumulating among a small number of actors, reducing checks and balances
- **<EntityLink id="E29">Authoritarian Takeover</EntityLink>**: AI enabling authoritarian regimes or actors to seize and maintain power
- **<EntityLink id="E374">Winner-Take-All Dynamics</EntityLink>**: AI markets and capabilities converging toward monopolistic or oligopolistic structures
- **<EntityLink id="E684">Compute Concentration</EntityLink>**: The physical infrastructure of AI concentrating among a few companies, creating structural dependencies

## Lock-in and Irreversibility

Risks of AI locking in values, structures, or trajectories that are difficult to change:

- **<EntityLink id="E189">Lock-in</EntityLink>**: AI systems or AI-shaped institutions perpetuating current values or power structures indefinitely
- **<EntityLink id="E179">Irreversibility</EntityLink>**: AI-driven changes that cannot be undone, closing off future options for course correction

## Competitive and Dynamic Risks

Risks from the competitive dynamics of AI development:

- **<EntityLink id="E239">Racing Dynamics</EntityLink>**: Competitive pressure between labs, companies, or nations leading to reduced safety investment
- **<EntityLink id="E209">Multipolar Trap</EntityLink>**: Situations where multiple actors are individually rational to develop AI aggressively, even though collective restraint would be better
- **<EntityLink id="E232">Proliferation</EntityLink>**: Spread of dangerous AI capabilities to actors unable or unwilling to use them safely
- **<EntityLink id="E142">Flash Dynamics</EntityLink>**: AI-enabled rapid cascading events that outpace human response capacity

## Economic and Social Disruption

Risks from AI's impact on economic and social systems:

- **<EntityLink id="E108">Economic Disruption</EntityLink>**: Large-scale labor market disruption and economic restructuring from AI automation
- **<EntityLink id="E118">Enfeeblement</EntityLink>**: Humans becoming increasingly dependent on AI systems, losing the capability to function without them
- **<EntityLink id="E126">Erosion of Human Agency</EntityLink>**: Gradual loss of meaningful human choice as AI systems optimize environments and decisions
- **AI Welfare and Digital Minds**: Emerging questions about moral consideration for AI systems

## Infrastructure Risks

Risks from the physical and digital infrastructure of AI:

- **Concentrated Compute as a Cybersecurity Risk**: The concentration of AI infrastructure creating novel attack surfaces
- **<EntityLink id="E684">Compute Concentration</EntityLink>**: Physical infrastructure concentration creating systemic dependencies and vulnerabilities

## Key Dynamics

**Gradual onset**: Many structural risks develop incrementally rather than through sudden events, making them harder to recognize and respond to until they are deeply entrenched.

**Interaction effects**: Structural risks interact with each other in reinforcing ways. <EntityLink id="E68">Power concentration</EntityLink> enables <EntityLink id="E189">lock-in</EntityLink>; <EntityLink id="E239">racing dynamics</EntityLink> increase <EntityLink id="E232">proliferation</EntityLink>; <EntityLink id="E108">economic disruption</EntityLink> can accelerate <EntityLink id="E29">authoritarian takeover</EntityLink>.

**Governance-sensitive**: Structural risks are particularly sensitive to governance choices. Effective <EntityLink id="E154">AI governance</EntityLink> can mitigate many structural risks, while governance failures can exacerbate them.
