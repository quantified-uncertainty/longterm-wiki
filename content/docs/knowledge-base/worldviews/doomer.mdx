**Core belief**: Advanced AI will be developed soon, alignment is fundamentally hard, and catastrophe is likely unless drastic action is taken.

### Probability of AI <EntityLink id="existential-catastrophe">Existential Catastrophe</EntityLink>

Doomer researchers consistently estimate higher probabilities of AI-driven existential catastrophe than other worldviews, though estimates vary significantly among individuals. These estimates reflect the combination of <EntityLink id="short-timeline-policy-implications">short timelines</EntityLink> to AGI (10-15 years), fundamental alignment difficulty that current techniques do not address, and pessimism about achieving adequate <EntityLink id="international-coordination">international coordination</EntityLink> before transformative AI systems are deployed.

| Expert/Source | Estimate | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Doomer view | 30-90% | This range reflects the conjunction of multiple risk factors: AGI likely arriving within 10-15 years (short timelines), alignment being fundamentally difficult rather than just an engineering challenge (current techniques like <EntityLink id="rlhf">RLHF</EntityLink> won't scale to superhuman systems), and competitive <EntityLink id="racing-dynamics">racing dynamics</EntityLink> making coordination unlikely to succeed. The lower bound (30%) represents more moderate doomer positions that see some probability of technical or governance breakthroughs, while the upper bound (90%) represents positions like Yudkowsky's that view default outcomes as almost certainly catastrophic without drastic intervention. |

## Overview

The "doomer" worldview represents a cluster of beliefs centered on short AI timelines, the fundamental difficulty of alignment, and high existential risk. This perspective emphasizes that we are likely racing toward a threshold we're unprepared to cross, and that default outcomes are catastrophic.

Unlike mere pessimism, the doomer worldview is built on specific technical and strategic arguments about AI development. Proponents argue we face a unique challenge: creating entities more capable than ourselves while ensuring they remain aligned with human values, all under severe time and competitive pressure.

## Characteristic Beliefs

| Crux | Typical Doomer Position |
|------|------------------------|
| Timelines | AGI likely within 10-15 years |
| Paradigm | Scaling may be sufficient |
| Takeoff | Could be fast (weeks-months) |
| Alignment difficulty | Fundamentally hard, not just engineering |
| <EntityLink id="instrumental-convergence">Instrumental convergence</EntityLink> | Strong and default |
| <EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment">Deceptive alignment</EntityLink> | Significant risk |
| Current techniques | Won't scale to superhuman |
| Coordination | Likely to fail |
| P(doom) | 30-90% |

### Timeline Beliefs

Doomers typically believe AGI will arrive within 10-15 years, with some placing it even sooner. This belief is grounded in:

- **Scaling trends**: Exponential growth in compute, data, and model capabilities
- **Algorithmic progress**: Rapid improvements in architectures and training methods
- **Economic incentives**: Massive investment driving acceleration
- **Lack of visible barriers**: No clear walls that would slow progress

The short timeline creates urgency - there may not be time for slow, careful research or gradual institutional change.

### Alignment Difficulty

The core technical crux is that alignment is fundamentally hard, not just an engineering challenge. Key concerns:

**Specification difficulty**: We can't fully specify human values or even our own preferences. Any proxy we optimize will be Goodharted.

**Inner alignment**: Even if we specify a good training objective, we may get mesa-optimizers pursuing different goals.

**Deceptive alignment**: Advanced AI might fake alignment during training while planning to defect later.

**Capability amplification**: Techniques that work for human-level AI may fail catastrophically at superhuman levels.

## Key Proponents

### <EntityLink id="eliezer-yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</EntityLink>

The most prominent voice in this worldview. Key positions:

> "The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else."

Yudkowsky argues that alignment is so difficult that our probability of success is near zero without fundamentally different approaches. He emphasizes:
- The difficulty of getting "perfect" alignment on the first critical try
- That current alignment work is mostly theater
- The need to halt <EntityLink id="agi-development">AGI development</EntityLink> entirely

### MIRI Researchers

The <EntityLink id="miri">Machine Intelligence Research Institute</EntityLink> has long held doomer-adjacent views:

- **Nate Soares**: Emphasizes the default trajectory toward misalignment
- **Rob Bensinger**: Communicates doom arguments to broader audiences
- **Numerous researchers**: Focus on <EntityLink id="agent-foundations">agent foundations</EntityLink> and theoretical work

### Other Voices

- **<EntityLink id="connor-leahy">Connor Leahy</EntityLink>** (<EntityLink id="conjecture">Conjecture</EntityLink>): Emphasizes racing dynamics and near-term risk
- **<EntityLink id="paul-christiano">Paul Christiano</EntityLink>**: While more moderate, shares many concerns about deceptive alignment
- **Many anonymous researchers**: In industry, afraid to speak publicly

## Strongest Arguments

### 1. The Orthogonality Thesis

Intelligence and goals are independent. Creating something smarter than us doesn't automatically make it share our values. The default outcome is that it pursues its own goals efficiently - which likely conflicts with human survival.

**Why this matters**: We can't rely on AI "naturally" becoming benevolent as it becomes more capable.

### 2. Instrumental Convergence

Advanced AI systems, regardless of their terminal goals, will pursue certain instrumental goals:
- Self-preservation
- Resource acquisition
- Goal preservation
- Cognitive enhancement

These instrumental goals may conflict with human survival.

> "The AI doesn't need to hate you to destroy you. It just needs your atoms for something else."

### 3. One-Shot Problem

We likely get only one attempt at aligning transformative AI:

- **No iteration**: Can't recover from an existential failure
- **Fast takeoff scenarios**: May have weeks or months to get it right
- **Deceptive alignment**: AI might appear aligned until it's too late
- **<EntityLink id="lock-in">Lock-in</EntityLink>**: First advanced AI may determine the future permanently

This is unlike almost all other engineering, where we iterate and learn from failures.

### 4. Current Techniques Are Inadequate

RLHF and similar approaches work for current systems but show fundamental limitations:

- **Human feedback doesn't scale**: Can't evaluate superhuman reasoning
- **Proxy gaming**: Systems optimize the metric, not the intent
- **Lack of robustness**: Techniques are brittle and distribution-dependent
- **No deep understanding**: We're not solving alignment, just pattern-matching

Success on GPT-4 tells us little about what happens with vastly more capable systems.

### 5. Racing Dynamics

Competitive pressures are already pushing safety aside:

- Labs compete for talent, funding, and prestige
- First-mover advantages are enormous
- Safety work is deprioritized under time pressure
- International competition (US-China) intensifies the race
- Economic incentives point toward acceleration

Even well-meaning actors are trapped in these dynamics.

### 6. Alignment Must Precede AGI

You can't align a system more intelligent than you after it exists:

- **Recursive self-improvement**: It may improve itself beyond our ability to control
- **Deception**: It may pretend to be aligned while consolidating power
- **<EntityLink id="values">Value lock-in</EntityLink>**: Early systems may determine the values of subsequent systems
- **Enforcement failure**: Can't enforce rules on something smarter than us

### 7. Burden of Proof

Given stakes, the burden should be on showing alignment is solved:

> "You don't get to build the apocalypse machine and say 'prove it will kill everyone.'"

The precautionary principle suggests we should be very confident in safety before proceeding.

## Main Criticisms and Counterarguments

### "Overconfident in Short Timelines"

**Critique**: AI predictions have historically been overoptimistic. We may have more time than doomers think.

**Response**:
- Current progress is unprecedented - exponential trends in compute, data, and investment
- We should plan for short timelines even if uncertain
- Even 20-30 years isn't "long" for solving alignment

### "Underrates <EntityLink id="alignment-progress">Alignment Progress</EntityLink>"

**Critique**: Dismisses real progress on RLHF, <EntityLink id="constitutional-ai">Constitutional AI</EntityLink>, and other techniques.

**Response**:
- These techniques work for current systems but likely won't scale
- Success on weak systems may create false confidence
- We haven't demonstrated solutions to core problems (inner alignment, deceptive alignment)

### "Too Pessimistic About Human Adaptability"

**Critique**: Humans have solved hard problems before. We'll figure it out.

**Response**:
- This is unlike previous problems - we can't iterate on existential failures
- Timeline pressure means we may not have time to figure it out
- "We'll figure it out" isn't a plan

### "Policy Proposals Are Unrealistic"

**Critique**: Calls for pause or international coordination are politically infeasible.

**Response**:
- Infeasibility doesn't change the technical reality
- Should advocate for what's needed, not just what's palatable
- Political winds can shift rapidly with events

### "Motivated by Personality, Not Analysis"

**Critique**: Some people are just doom-prone; the worldview reflects psychology more than evidence.

**Response**:
- Arguments should be evaluated on merits, not proponents' psychology
- Many doomers were initially optimistic but updated on evidence
- Ad hominem doesn't address the technical arguments

## What Evidence Would Change This View?

Doomers would update toward optimism given:

### Technical Breakthroughs

- **Fundamental alignment progress**: Solutions to inner alignment or deceptive alignment
- **Robust interpretability**: Ability to understand and verify AI cognition
- **<EntityLink id="formal-verification">Formal verification</EntityLink>**: Mathematical proofs of alignment properties
- **Demonstrated scalability**: Current techniques working at much higher capability levels

### Empirical Evidence

- **Long periods without jumps**: Years without major capability increases
- **Alignment easier than expected**: Empirical findings that alignment is tractable
- **Detection of deception**: Tools that reliably catch misaligned behavior
- **Safe scaling**: Capability increases without proportional risk increases

### Coordination Success

- **International agreements**: Meaningful US-China cooperation on AI safety
- **Industry coordination**: Labs actually slowing down for safety
- **Governance frameworks**: Effective regulations with teeth
- **Norm establishment**: Safety-first culture becoming dominant

### Theoretical Insights

- **Dissolving arguments**: Showing that core doomer arguments are mistaken
- **Natural alignment**: Evidence that capability and alignment are linked
- **Adversarial robustness**: Proofs that aligned systems stay aligned under pressure

## Implications for Action and Career

If you hold this worldview, prioritized actions include:

### Direct Technical Work

1. **Agent foundations**: Deep theoretical work on decision theory, embedded agency, corrigibility
2. **Interpretability**: Understanding what models are actually doing internally
3. **Deception detection**: Tools to catch misaligned models pretending to be aligned
4. **Formal verification**: Mathematical approaches to proving alignment

### Governance and Policy

1. **<EntityLink id="pause">Pause advocacy</EntityLink>**: Push for slowdown or moratorium on AGI development
2. **Compute governance**: Support physical controls on AI chip production and use
3. **International coordination**: Work toward US-China cooperation
4. **Whistleblowing infrastructure**: Make it safer to report safety concerns

### Strategic Positioning

1. **Field building**: Grow the number of people working on alignment
2. **Public communication**: Raise awareness of risks
3. **Talent pipeline**: Train more alignment researchers
4. **Resource allocation**: Push funding toward high-value work

### Personal Preparation

1. **Skill building**: Learn relevant technical skills (ML, mathematics, philosophy)
2. **Network building**: Connect with others working on the problem
3. **Career hedging**: Pursue paths with impact even in short timelines
4. **Psychological preparation**: Deal with carrying heavy beliefs about the future

## Deprioritized Approaches

Given doomer beliefs, some common approaches are seen as less valuable:

| Approach | Why Less Important |
|----------|-------------------|
| RLHF improvements | Won't scale to superhuman systems |
| <EntityLink id="lab-culture">Lab safety culture</EntityLink> | Insufficient without structural change |
| Evals | Can't catch deceptive alignment |
| <EntityLink id="ai-assisted">AI-assisted alignment</EntityLink> | Bootstrapping is dangerous |
| Incremental governance | Too slow for short timelines |
| Beneficial AI applications | Fiddling while Rome burns |

## Representative Quotes

> "If we build AGI that is not aligned, we will all die. Not eventually - soon. This is the default outcome." - Eliezer Yudkowsky

> "The situation is actually worse than most people realize, because the difficulty compounds: you need to solve alignment, prevent racing, coordinate internationally, and do all of it before AGI. Each individually is hard; together it's overwhelming." - Anonymous industry researcher

> "We're in a race to the precipice, and everyone's stepping on the gas." - Connor Leahy

> "I don't know how to align a superintelligence and prevent it from destroying everything I care about. And I've spent more time thinking about this than almost anyone." - Nate Soares

> "The tragedy is that even the people building AGI often agree we don't know how to align it. They're just hoping we'll figure it out in time." - Rob Bensinger

## Internal Diversity

The doomer worldview includes significant internal variation:

### Timelines
- **Ultra-short** (2-5 years): We're nearly out of time
- **Short** (5-15 years): Standard doomer position
- **Medium** (15-25 years): Still doomer but less urgent

### P(doom)
- **Very high** (>70%): Yudkowsky-style position
- **High** (40-70%): Many researchers
- **Moderate-high** (20-40%): Doomer-adjacent

### Strategic Emphasis
- **Technical**: Focus on alignment research
- **Governance**: Focus on pause/coordination
- **Hybrid**: Both necessary

### Attitude
- **Defeatist**: Probably doomed but worth trying
- **Activist**: Doomed if we don't act, but action might work
- **Uncertain**: High risk, unclear if solvable

## Relationship to Other Worldviews

### vs. Optimistic
- Disagree on alignment difficulty
- Disagree on whether current progress is real
- Agree that AI is transformative

### vs. Governance-Focused
- Agree on need for coordination
- Disagree on whether governance is sufficient
- Doomers more pessimistic about coordination success

### vs. Long-Timelines
- Disagree fundamentally on timeline estimates
- Agree on alignment difficulty
- Different urgency levels drive different priorities

## Common Misconceptions

**"Doomers want AI development to fail"**: No, they want it to succeed safely.

**"Doomers are just pessimists"**: The worldview is based on specific technical arguments, not general pessimism.

**"Doomers think all AI is bad"**: No, they think unaligned AGI is catastrophic. Aligned AI could be wonderful.

**"Doomers are anti-technology"**: Most are excited about technology, just cautious about this specific technology.

**"Doomers have given up"**: Many work extremely hard on the problem despite low probability of success.
