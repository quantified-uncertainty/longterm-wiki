title: Long-Timelines Technical Worldview
description: The long-timelines worldview (20-40+ years to AGI) argues for foundational research over rushed solutions based on historical AI overoptimism, current systems' limitations, and scaling constraints. While Metaculus forecasters now predict a 50% chance of AGI by 2031—down from 50 years away in 2020—long-timelines proponents point to survey findings that 76% of experts believe current scaling approaches are insufficient for AGI.

### Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Current Consensus** | Minority position among AI researchers | <EntityLink id="metaculus">Metaculus</EntityLink> median AGI prediction: 2031; industry leaders predict 2-5 years |
| **Expert Support** | 20-30% of surveyed researchers | [76% believe scaling alone insufficient](https://gizmodo.com/ai-experts-say-were-on-the-wrong-path-to-achieving-human-like-ai-2000581717) for AGI |
| **Historical Track Record** | Strong precedent for skepticism | AI predictions consistently wrong for 60+ years |
| **Core Crux** | Paradigm sufficiency | Whether deep learning + scaling reaches general intelligence |
| **Research Priority** | Foundational theory | <EntityLink id="agent-foundations">Agent foundations</EntityLink>, interpretability theory, <EntityLink id="formal-verification">formal verification</EntityLink> |
| **Risk Assessment (P(doom))** | 5-20% by 2100 | Lower than doomer estimates (25-80%) due to extended timeline |
| **Funding Alignment** | Supports longer-term research | AI safety research receives only \$110-170M/year vs \$252B corporate AI investment |

**Core belief**: Transformative AI is further away than many think. This gives us time for careful, foundational research rather than rushed solutions.

### Timeline to AGI

The long-timelines worldview predicts significantly longer development horizons than short-timelines perspectives, fundamentally altering strategic priorities for AI safety research and intervention planning. As of December 2024, [Metaculus forecasters](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/) average a 25% chance of AGI by 2027 and 50% by 2031—down from a median of 50 years away as recently as 2020.

| Source | AGI Estimate | Methodology | Confidence Level |
|--------|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Long-timelines view** | 2045-2065+ | Historical pattern analysis + paradigm skepticism | Medium-High |
| [Metaculus forecasters](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/) (2024) | 2031 (50% median) | Aggregated prediction market | 1,700 forecasters |
| [AI researcher survey](https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/) (2023) | 2047-2116 | Academic survey | Median varies 70 years by framing |
| [Epoch AI Direct Approach](https://epoch.ai/blog/literature-review-of-transformative-artificial-intelligence-timelines) | 2033 (50%) | Compute trend extrapolation | Model-based estimate |
| Industry leaders (<EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>) | 2027-2030 | Internal capability assessment | Shortest estimates, potential bias |
| [Rodney Brooks](https://rodneybrooks.com/predictions-scorecard-2025-january-01/) | Far, far further than claimed | Historical track record analysis | Publicly tracked predictions |

**Key divergence**: The 13-year median shift in AI researcher surveys between 2022-2023 suggests high uncertainty and susceptibility to framing effects. Long-timelines proponents argue this volatility reflects hype cycles rather than genuine technical progress toward AGI.

### P(AI <EntityLink id="existential-catastrophe">existential catastrophe</EntityLink> by 2100)

While taking AI risk seriously, the long-timelines worldview assigns lower probabilities to existential catastrophe due to extended opportunity for alignment research, iterative testing, and institutional adaptation.

| Expert/Source | Estimate | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Long-timelines view | 5-20% | Extended timelines provide multiple advantages for safety: decades for careful foundational research on agent alignment theory, time to observe warning signs in increasingly capable systems, opportunity for <EntityLink id="international-coordination">international coordination</EntityLink> and governance development, and ability to iterate on alignment techniques across multiple generations of AI systems. The lower bound reflects that alignment remains genuinely difficult even with more time; the upper bound acknowledges we might still fail to solve core technical challenges. |

## Overview

The long-timelines technical worldview holds that transformative AI is decades away rather than years. This isn't mere optimism or wishful thinking - it's based on specific views about the difficulty of achieving human-level intelligence, skepticism about current paradigms, and historical patterns in AI progress.

`} />

This extended timeline fundamentally changes strategic priorities. Instead of rushing to patch current systems or advocating for immediate pause, long-timelines researchers can pursue deep, foundational work that might take decades to bear fruit.

**Key distinction**: This is not the same as the optimistic worldview. Long-timelines researchers take alignment seriously and don't trust current techniques to scale. They're not optimistic about alignment being easy - they're pessimistic about timelines being short.

## Characteristic Beliefs

| Crux | Long-Timelines Position | Short-Timelines Position | Key Evidence |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Timelines** | AGI 20-40+ years (2045-2065) | AGI 2-10 years (2027-2035) | Survey framing effects cause 70-year median variance |
| **Paradigm** | New paradigms required beyond scaling | Scaling + engineering solves remaining gaps | [76% of experts](https://gizmodo.com/ai-experts-say-were-on-the-wrong-path-to-achieving-human-like-ai-2000581717) say scaling alone insufficient |
| **Takeoff** | Slow, observable over years | Fast or discontinuous possible | Historical technology adoption rates |
| **Scaling outlook** | Diminishing returns imminent | Continued exponential gains | [Ilya Sutskever](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/): "Age of scaling" may be ending |
| **Alignment difficulty** | Hard, but sufficient time to solve | Hard, and racing against clock | Depends on timeline beliefs |
| **Current LLM relevance** | Uncertain if informs future AGI | Direct path to AGI | Architectural discontinuity question |
| **Deceptive alignment** | Relevant but not imminent threat | Critical near-term concern | Capability threshold dependent |
| **Coordination feasibility** | More feasible with extended time | Difficult under time pressure | [AI safety funding](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-summer-2025/): \$150-170M vs \$252B AI investment |
| **P(doom)** | 5-20% by 2100 | 25-80% by 2100 | Extended time for iteration and response |

### Timeline Arguments

Several independent arguments support longer timelines:

**1. Intelligence is harder than it looks**

Current AI systems are impressive but lack capabilities that [Melanie Mitchell](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8175) argues are fundamental to general intelligence:
- **Robust generalization**: Systems fail in novel contexts despite strong benchmark performance
- **Abstract reasoning**: [Mitchell's 2024 research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10717) shows current AI lacks humanlike abstraction and analogy capabilities
- **World models**: AI lacks "rich internal models of the world" that reflect causes rather than correlations
- **Efficient learning**: Humans learn from limited examples; LLMs require massive data
- **Common sense**: Fundamental gaps in causal and physical reasoning persist

Each of these might require breakthroughs that scaling alone cannot provide.

**2. Historical track record**

AI predictions have consistently been overoptimistic—[Rodney Brooks](https://rodneybrooks.com/predictions-scorecard-2025-january-01/) has publicly tracked failed predictions since 2017:

| Era | Prediction | Reality | Years Off |
|-----|------------|---------|-----------|
| 1960s | Human-level AI by 1985 | First AI winter | 40+ years |
| 1980s | Expert systems would transform economy | Brittleness, second AI winter | 30+ years |
| 2017 | Full self-driving by 2020 | GM shut Cruise after \$10B investment (2024) | Ongoing |
| 2023 | LLMs are path to near-term AGI | Scaling showing [diminishing returns](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/) | TBD |

As Brooks notes: "None" of the 2017 near-term predictions have materialized.

**3. Scaling might not be enough**

While scaling has driven recent progress, multiple experts warn of limits:

[Ilya Sutskever](https://officechai.com/ai/scaling-could-now-give-diminishing-returns-were-back-to-the-age-of-research-ilya-sutskever/) (OpenAI co-founder, Safe Superintelligence Inc.): "From 2012 to 2020, it was the age of research. From 2020 to 2025, it was the age of scaling... I don't think that's true anymore."

| Constraint | Current Status | Long-Term Trajectory |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Compute costs** | GPT-4 training: \$100M+; next-gen: \$1B+ | Superlinear cost growth per capability unit |
| **Data availability** | Already training on most of internet | [Synthetic data quality issues](https://epoch.ai/blog/can-ai-scaling-continue-through-2030) uncertain |
| **Energy requirements** | Data centers consuming city-scale power | Environmental and infrastructure limits |
| **Algorithmic efficiency** | 2024 gains primarily in post-training | Pre-training scaling laws potentially breaking down |

[Gary Marcus](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/a-knockout-blow-for-llms) coined "diminishing returns" in 2022; recent observations suggest "adding more data does not actually solve the core underlying problems."

**4. Economic and institutional barriers**

Even if technically feasible, deployment faces substantial friction:
- **Compute costs**: Training frontier models now costs \$100M-1B+, limiting who can participate
- **Energy requirements**: Data centers require gigawatts; infrastructure buildout takes years
- **Capital requirements**: [Global AI investment reached \$252B in 2024](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy), but concentrated in few actors
- **Regulatory barriers**: EU AI Act, emerging US state legislation creating compliance costs
- **Adoption timelines**: Brooks notes even IPv4→IPv6 transition, started in 2001, is still only 50% complete

### Takeoff Speed

Long-timelines researchers typically expect slow takeoff:

**Gradual progress**: Incremental improvements across many years
- Can observe AI getting more capable
- Time to respond to warning signs
- Opportunities to iterate on alignment

**Multiple bottlenecks**: Progress limited by many factors
- Hardware constraints
- Data availability
- Algorithmic insights
- Integration challenges
- Social and regulatory adaptation

**Continuous deployment**: AI capabilities integrated gradually
- Society adapts incrementally
- Institutions evolve alongside AI
- Norms and regulations co-develop

This contrasts sharply with fast takeoff scenarios where recursive self-improvement leads to rapid capability explosion.

## Key Proponents and Perspectives

### Academic Researchers

**[Rodney Brooks](https://rodneybrooks.com/)** (former MIT CSAIL director, iRobot/Robust.AI founder)

> "Even if it is possible I personally think we are far, far further away from understanding how to build AGI than many other pundits might say."

| Prediction Area | Brooks' Assessment | Track Record |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Self-driving cars | Too optimistic by 10+ years | [GM shut Cruise](https://rodneybrooks.com/predictions-scorecard-2025-january-01/) after \$10B investment |
| LLM-to-AGI path | "Hubris similar to 2017 self-driving" | Publicly tracking since 2017 |
| Technology adoption | Consistently overestimated speed | IPv4→IPv6: 23+ years, still 50% complete |
| Current AI research | "Stuck on same issues for 50 years" | Common sense, reasoning gaps persist |

Brooks warns of ["FOBAWTPALSL"](https://spectrum.ieee.org/gary-marcus)—Fear of Being a Wimpy Techno-Pessimist and Looking Stupid Later—driving uncritical AI optimism.

**[Gary Marcus](https://garymarcus.substack.com/)** (NYU emeritus, cognitive scientist)

Published ["Deep Learning: A Critical Appraisal"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631) (2018) identifying 10 fundamental limitations, and ["Taming Silicon Valley"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262048835/taming-silicon-valley/) (2024) arguing "we are not on the best path right now, either technically or morally."

Key arguments:
- **Brittleness**: Systems fail unpredictably on slight distribution shifts
- **Hybrid AI necessity**: Combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning (e.g., AlphaFold2) works better than pure deep learning
- **Generalization failures**: Pattern matching is not understanding
- **Financial bubble**: "People are valuing AI companies as if they're going to solve AGI. I don't think we're anywhere near AGI."

**[Melanie Mitchell](https://melaniemitchell.me/)** (Santa Fe Institute)

Author of *Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans* (2019); published [four major papers in 2024](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8175) on AI limitations including work in *Science*.

Key research findings:
- **Abstraction gap**: "No current AI system is anywhere close to a capability of forming humanlike abstractions or analogies"
- **World model deficit**: AI lacks "rich internal models of the world that reflect the causes of events rather than merely correlations"
- **Benchmark failure**: "AI systems ace benchmarks yet stumble in the real world"
- **AGI skepticism**: "Today's AI is far from general intelligence, and I don't believe that machine 'superintelligence' is anywhere on the horizon"

### Survey Evidence

A [2024 survey](https://gizmodo.com/ai-experts-say-were-on-the-wrong-path-to-achieving-human-like-ai-2000581717) chaired by Brooks found:
- **76% of 475 respondents** said scaling current approaches will not be sufficient for AGI
- This challenges the dominant industry narrative that "more compute = AGI"

### Alignment Researchers with Longer Timelines

Not all alignment researchers believe in short timelines:
- Focus on foundational theory requiring 10-20+ year research programs
- Skeptical current LLM architectures inform future AGI systems
- Prefer robust solutions over patches that may not transfer

## Priority Approaches

Given long-timelines beliefs, research priorities differ from short-timelines views. The extended horizon allows investment in high-risk, high-reward research that requires decades to mature.

### Research Priority Comparison

| Approach | Long-Timelines Priority | Short-Timelines Priority | Funding Status (2024-25) |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Agent foundations** | Very High | Low-Medium | \$5-15M/year via MIRI, academic grants |
| **Mechanistic interpretability** | High | High | \$30-50M/year via labs + Coefficient Giving |
| **RLHF/current alignment** | Low-Medium | Very High | \$100M+/year via frontier labs |
| **Formal verification** | High | Low | \$10-20M/year, primarily academic |
| **Field building/education** | Very High | Medium | \$20-40M/year via foundations |
| **Pause/moratorium advocacy** | Low | High | Variable, advocacy-funded |
| **Compute governance** | Medium | Very High | Government + policy focus |
| **Rapid deployment safety** | Low | Very High | Lab-funded, urgent framing |

**Funding context**: [AI safety research receives only \$150-170M/year](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-summer-2025/) total (up 36% from 2024), while [corporate AI investment reached \$252B in 2024](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy). Long-timelines proponents argue foundational work is underfunded relative to its importance if timelines extend.

### 1. Agent Foundations

Deep theoretical work on fundamental questions:

**Decision theory**:
- How should rational agents behave?
- Logical uncertainty
- Updateless decision theory
- Embedded agency

**Value alignment theory**:
- What does it mean for an agent to have values?
- How can values be specified?
- Corrigibility and interruptibility
- Utility function construction

**Ontological crises**:
- How do agents update when their world model changes fundamentally?
- Preserving values across paradigm shifts

**Advantage of long timelines**: This work might take 10-20 years to mature, which is fine if AGI is 30+ years away.

### 2. Interpretability and Understanding

Deep understanding of how AI systems work:

**Mechanistic interpretability**:
- Reverse-engineer neural networks
- Understand individual neurons and circuits
- Build comprehensive models of model internals

**Theoretical foundations**:
- Why do neural networks generalize?
- What are the fundamental limits?
- Mathematical theory of deep learning

**Conceptual understanding**:
- What are models actually learning?
- Representations and abstractions
- Transfer and generalization

**Advantage of long timelines**: Can build interpretability tools gradually, improving them over decades.

### 3. Foundational Research

First-principles approaches without time pressure:

**Alternative paradigms**:
- Explore architectures beyond current deep learning
- Investigate hybrid systems
- Study biological intelligence for insights

**Robustness and verification**:
- Formal methods for AI
- Provable safety properties
- Mathematical guarantees

**Comprehensive testing**:
- Extensive empirical research
- Long-term studies of AI behavior
- Edge case exploration

**Advantage of long timelines**: Can pursue high-risk, high-reward research without urgency.

### 4. Field Building

Growing the community for long-term impact:

**Academic infrastructure**:
- University departments and programs
- Curriculum development
- Textbooks and educational materials

**Talent pipeline**:
- Undergraduate and graduate training
- Interdisciplinary programs
- Career paths in alignment

**Research ecosystem**:
- Conferences and workshops
- Journals and publications
- Collaboration networks

**Advantage of long timelines**: Field-building pays off over decades.

### 5. Careful Empirical Work

Thorough investigation of current systems:

**Understanding limitations**:
- Where do current approaches fail?
- What are fundamental vs. contingent limits?
- Generalization studies

**Alignment properties**:
- How do current alignment techniques work?
- What are their scaling properties?
- When do they break down?

**Transfer studies**:
- Will current insights transfer to future AI?
- What's paradigm-specific vs. general?

**Advantage of long timelines**: Can be thorough rather than rushed.

## Deprioritized Approaches

Given long-timelines beliefs, some approaches are less urgent:

| Approach | Why Less Urgent |
|----------|----------------|
| Pause advocacy | Less immediate urgency |
| RLHF improvements | May not transfer to future paradigms |
| Current-system safety | Systems may not be path to AGI |
| Race dynamics | More time reduces racing pressure |
| Quick fixes | Can pursue robust solutions instead |

**Note**: "Less urgent" doesn't mean "useless" - just different prioritization given beliefs.

## Strongest Arguments

### 1. Historical Overoptimism

AI predictions have been systematically wrong for 60+ years. [80,000 Hours analysis](https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/) shows median expert estimates have shortened by 13 years between 2022-2023 surveys alone—suggesting high volatility driven by hype rather than genuine progress.

| Period | Prediction | Outcome | Investment Lost/Delayed |
|--------|------------|---------|------------------------|
| 1965-1975 | Machine translation "solved in 5 years" | ALPAC report ended funding | \$20M+ wasted |
| 1980-1987 | Expert systems market \$5B by 1990 | Second AI winter; Lisp machine collapse | \$1B+ industry crash |
| 2012-2017 | Self-driving by 2020 | [GM shut Cruise](https://rodneybrooks.com/predictions-scorecard-2025-january-01/) after \$10B | \$100B+ industry-wide |
| 2020-2023 | LLM scaling → AGI in 3-5 years | [Scaling hitting diminishing returns](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/) | TBD |

**Pattern**: Each generation thinks they're on the path to AGI. Each is wrong. Current optimism about LLMs may repeat this pattern—[76% of surveyed experts](https://gizmodo.com/ai-experts-say-were-on-the-wrong-path-to-achieving-human-like-ai-2000581717) believe scaling alone insufficient.

### 2. Current Systems' Fundamental Limitations

Despite impressive performance, current AI lacks:

**Robust generalization**:
- Adversarial examples fool vision systems
- Out-of-distribution failures
- Brittle in novel situations

**True understanding**:
- Pattern matching vs. comprehension
- Lack of world models
- No common sense reasoning

**Efficient learning**:
- Require massive data (humans learn from few examples)
- Don't transfer knowledge well across domains
- Can't explain their reasoning reliably

**Abstract reasoning**:
- Struggle with novel problems requiring insight
- Limited analogical reasoning
- Poor at systematic generalization

**These might require fundamental breakthroughs**, not just scaling.

### 3. Scaling Has Limits

Current progress relies on scaling, but:

**Compute constraints**:
- Energy costs grow exponentially
- Chip production has physical limits
- Economic viability uncertain at extreme scales

**Data constraints**:
- Already training on most of internet
- Synthetic data has quality issues
- Diminishing returns from more data

**Algorithmic efficiency**:
- Gains are uncertain and irregular
- May hit fundamental limits
- Efficiency improvements are hard to predict

**Returns diminishing**:
- Each order of magnitude improvement costs more
- Performance gains may be slowing
- Knee of the curve might be near

### 4. Intelligence Requires More Than Current Approaches

Cognitive science and neuroscience suggest:

**Embodiment**: Intelligence might require physical interaction with world

**Development**: Human intelligence develops through years of experience

**Architecture**: Brain has specialized structures deep learning lacks

**Mechanisms**: Biological learning uses mechanisms we don't understand

**Consciousness**: Role of consciousness in intelligence unclear

**If any of these are necessary**, current approaches are missing key ingredients.

### 5. Slow Takeoff Is Likely

Multiple bottlenecks slow progress:

**Integration challenges**: Deploying AI into real systems takes time

**Social adaptation**: Society needs to adapt to new capabilities

**Institutional barriers**: Regulation, cultural resistance, coordination

**Economic constraints**: Funding and resources are limited

**Technical obstacles**: Each capability advance requires solving multiple problems

**No reason to expect rapid discontinuities** - smooth progress is default.

### 6. Time for Solutions Reduces Risk

Longer timelines mean:

**Iterative improvement**: Can refine alignment techniques over decades

**Warning signs**: Early systems give us data about problems

**Coordination**: More time for international cooperation

**Institution building**: Governance can develop alongside technology

**Research maturation**: Alignment solutions can be thoroughly tested

**P(doom) is lower** because we have time to get it right.

## Main Criticisms and Counterarguments

### "This Is Just Wishful Thinking"

**Critique**: Long-timelines view is motivated by hoping for more time, not actual evidence.

**Response**:
- Based on specific technical arguments, not hope
- Historical track record supports skepticism
- Many long-timelines people still take risk seriously
- If anything, short timelines might be motivated by excitement/fear

### "Might Miss Critical Window"

**Critique**: If wrong about timelines, current window to shape AI development is missed.

**Response**:
- Can have uncertainty and hedge bets
- Foundational work pays off even in shorter timelines
- Better to have robust solutions late than rushed solutions now
- Can shift priorities if evidence changes

### "Current Progress Is Different"

**Critique**: Unlike past failed approaches, deep learning and scaling are actually working. This time is different.

**Response**:
- Every generation thinks "this time is different"
- Deep learning has made progress but also has clear limits
- Scaling can't continue indefinitely
- Path from current systems to AGI remains unclear

### "LLMs Show Emergent Capabilities"

**Critique**: Large language models show unexpected emergent abilities, suggesting scaling might reach AGI.

**Response**:
- "Emergent" capabilities often just smooth trends that appear suddenly in metrics
- Still lack robust reasoning, planning, and understanding
- Emergence in narrow tasks doesn't imply general intelligence
- May hit ceiling well below human-level

### "Moravec's Paradox Resolved"

**Critique**: Deep learning solved perception problems thought to be hardest (vision, language). The rest will follow.

**Response**:
- Perception was hard for symbolic AI, not necessarily hardest overall
- Reasoning and planning might be fundamentally harder
- "Harder" tasks (like abstract reasoning) remain difficult for current AI
- Different problems might require different solutions

### "Missing Urgency"

**Critique**: Even if timelines are long, should work urgently to be safe.

**Response**:
- Urgency doesn't mean rushing to bad solutions
- Careful work is more valuable than hasty work
- Can be thorough without being complacent
- False urgency leads to wasted effort

### "Paradigm Shifts Can Be Rapid"

**Critique**: Even if deep learning isn't enough, sudden breakthroughs could change timelines overnight.

**Response**:
- Breakthroughs still require years to commercialize
- Integration takes time even if insight is sudden
- Most progress is gradual, not revolutionary
- Can update if breakthrough occurs

## What Evidence Would Change This View?

Long-timelines researchers would update toward shorter timelines given specific, measurable developments:

### Evidence That Would Strongly Update Toward Shorter Timelines

| Evidence Type | Specific Threshold | Current Status (2025) | Update Magnitude |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Scaling continuation** | 2+ more OOMs without diminishing returns | [Returns appear diminishing](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/ai-scaling-laws-are-showing-diminishing-returns-forcing-ai-labs-to-change-course/) | Very strong update |
| **Robust reasoning** | Pass novel math/science problems consistently | Fails on out-of-distribution | Strong update |
| **Transfer learning** | Same model excels across 10+ very different domains | Still domain-specific fine-tuning needed | Strong update |
| **Common sense** | Pass adversarial physical reasoning tests | [Mitchell's research](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8175) shows consistent failures | Strong update |
| **Expert consensus shift** | Greater than 70% of surveyed researchers predict AGI within 10 years | Currently approximately 30-40% | Moderate update |
| **Prediction market movement** | [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/) median drops below 2028 | Currently 2031 median | Moderate update |

### Theoretical Breakthroughs That Would Update

- **Clear path to generalization**: Formal demonstration that current architectures can achieve human-level abstraction
- **World model success**: AI systems building accurate causal models (not just correlations)
- **Efficient learning**: Systems learning as efficiently as humans (100x-1000x data reduction)

### Economic/Investment Indicators

Current investment levels ([2024: \$252B corporate, \$150-170M safety](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report/economy)) already suggest serious commitment. Further indicators:

- **Government Manhattan Project**: \$50B+/year coordinated government program (currently \$3.3B federal)
- **Energy breakthrough**: Fusion or next-gen nuclear enabling 10x cheaper compute
- **Chip breakthrough**: 100x efficiency gains beyond current trajectory

### What Has Already Updated Timelines

Several developments have shortened some long-timelines estimates:
- GPT-4/Claude-level reasoning capabilities (2023-2024)
- Chain-of-thought and reasoning improvements
- Multimodal integration success
- Test-time compute scaling (o1, etc.)

However, these haven't addressed the [core limitations Mitchell identifies](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8175)—abstraction, world models, efficient learning—that long-timelines proponents consider fundamental.

## Internal Diversity

The long-timelines worldview includes significant variation:

### Timeline Estimates

**Medium** (20-30 years): More cautious, still somewhat urgent

**Long** (30-50 years): Standard long-timelines position

**Very long** (50+ years): Highly skeptical of current approaches

### Risk Assessment

**Moderate risk, long timelines**: Still concerned but have time

**Low risk, long timelines**: Technical problem is tractable with time

**High risk, long timelines**: Hard problem, fortunately have time

### Research Focus

**Pure theory**: Agent foundations, decision theory

**Applied theory**: Interpretability, verification

**Empirical**: Understanding current systems

**Hybrid**: Combination of approaches

### Attitude Toward Current Work

**Skeptical**: Current LLM work likely irrelevant to AGI

**Uncertain**: Might be relevant, worth studying

**Engaged**: Working on current systems while believing AGI is far

## Representative Quotes

> "Every decade, people think AGI is 20 years away. It's been this way for 60 years. Maybe we should update on that." - Rodney Brooks

> "Current AI is like a high school student who crammed for the test - impressive performance on specific tasks, but lacking deep understanding." - Gary Marcus

> "The gap between narrow AI and general intelligence is not about scale - it's about fundamental architecture and learning mechanisms we don't yet understand." - Melanie Mitchell

> "I'd rather solve alignment properly over 20 years than rush to a solution in 5 years that fails catastrophically." - Long-timelines researcher

> "The best research takes time. If we have that time, we should use it wisely rather than pretending we don't." - Academic alignment researcher

## Common Misconceptions

**"Long-timelines people aren't worried about AI risk"**: False - they take it seriously but believe we have time

**"It's just procrastination"**: No - it's a belief about technology development pace

**"They're not working on alignment"**: Many do foundational alignment work

**"They think alignment is easy"**: No - they think it's hard but we have time to solve it

**"They're out of touch with recent progress"**: Many are deep in the technical details

## Strategic Implications

### If Long Timelines Are Correct

**Good news**:
- Time for careful research
- Can build robust solutions
- Opportunity for coordination
- Field can mature properly

**Challenges**:
- Maintaining focus over decades
