## Overview

People working on AI safety hold diverse worldviews that lead to different risk assessments and priorities. Understanding these worldviews helps explain disagreements and enables more productive dialogue.

## Major Worldviews

### <EntityLink id="E504">Doomer</EntityLink>
Believes AI existential risk is very high (often >50% p(doom)):
- Alignment is fundamentally hard
- Current approaches are inadequate
- We may not get many chances to get it right
- Often associated with: <EntityLink id="E202">MIRI</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="E114">Eliezer Yudkowsky</EntityLink>, some AI safety researchers

### <EntityLink id="E505">Long Timelines</EntityLink>
Believes transformative AI is further away (20+ years):
- More time to solve alignment
- Current risks are more speculative
- Near-term concerns deserve more attention
- Associated with: Some ML researchers, AI ethics community

### <EntityLink id="E397">Governance Focused</EntityLink>
Prioritizes policy and institutional solutions:
- Technical alignment is necessary but insufficient
- <EntityLink id="E239">Racing dynamics</EntityLink> are the key problem
- <EntityLink id="E171">International coordination</EntityLink> is critical
- Associated with: <EntityLink id="E153">GovAI</EntityLink>, policy researchers, some EA organizations

### <EntityLink id="E506">Optimistic</EntityLink>
Believes alignment is likely to succeed:
- Current research is making real progress
- Markets and institutions create safety incentives
- Past technology fears were often overblown
- Associated with: Some lab researchers, techno-optimists

## How Worldviews Affect Priorities

| Worldview | Technical Research | Governance | Timelines | Key Intervention |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| Doomer | Critical but may be hopeless | Valuable | Short | Pause/slow down |
| Long Timelines | Important, time available | Moderate priority | Long | Gradual progress |
| Governance Focused | Necessary | Highest priority | Medium | Coordination |
| Optimistic | On track | Light touch | Medium | Continue current |

## Using Worldview Analysis

Explicitly identifying worldview assumptions helps:
- Understand why experts disagree
- Identify which cruxes would change conclusions
- Design robustly valuable interventions
- Have more productive conversations
