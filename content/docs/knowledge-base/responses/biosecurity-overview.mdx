## Overview

The EA/x-risk community funds and operates a portfolio of biosecurity interventions designed to reduce catastrophic biological risks—both from natural pandemics and from deliberate misuse of advancing biotechnology and AI capabilities. <EntityLink id="open-philanthropy">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> alone has directed \$230M+ toward biosecurity through 140+ grants.[^1]

These interventions are organized around Kevin Esvelt's **Delay, Detect, Defend** framework, which structures biosecurity responses into three complementary layers: slowing dangerous capability proliferation, building early warning systems for novel threats, and developing resilience through countermeasures and physical defenses.

`} />

- **Delay** interventions buy time by slowing the proliferation of dangerous capabilities—through DNA synthesis screening, AI output restrictions, and governance frameworks like the Biological Weapons Convention.
- **Detect** interventions build early warning systems. The most distinctive EA contribution here is **untargeted metagenomic surveillance** (sequencing all genetic material in wastewater samples), which can detect completely novel or engineered pathogens that would evade traditional PCR-based testing.
- **Defend** interventions build resilience so societies can survive even if delay and detection fail. This includes medical countermeasures (platform vaccines, broad-spectrum antivirals), far-UVC pathogen inactivation technology, and improved PPE.

The framework treats these layers as complementary: restrictions buy time while detection and defense infrastructure scales up.

## Intervention Categories

| Intervention | Key Actors | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **DNA Synthesis Screening** | <EntityLink id="securedna">SecureDNA</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="ibbis">IBBIS</EntityLink>/NTI, IGSC | Preventing orders of synthetic DNA that could reconstruct dangerous pathogens. SecureDNA provides free cryptographic screening to synthesis providers. |
| **Metagenomic Surveillance** | <EntityLink id="securebio">SecureBio</EntityLink>/NAO, CDC | The Nucleic Acid Observatory sequences all genetic material in wastewater to detect novel threats. CDC's proposed Biothreat Radar (\$52M) builds on this work.[^2] |
| **AI Bio-Capability Evaluations** | SecureBio (VCT), Anthropic, OpenAI, RAND | Testing whether AI systems can meaningfully assist bioweapon development, including the Virology Capabilities Test and red-team studies.[^3] |
| **Medical Countermeasures** | <EntityLink id="red-queen-bio">Red Queen Bio</EntityLink>, BARDA, CEPI | "Defensive co-scaling"—pre-building countermeasures against AI-mapped biothreats. Platform vaccines and broad-spectrum antivirals. |
| **Far-UVC & Physical Defenses** | <EntityLink id="blueprint-biosecurity">Blueprint Biosecurity</EntityLink>, Columbia University | Far-UVC light (222nm) inactivates 99.8% of airborne pathogens in occupied spaces. Blueprint runs the EXHALE evaluation program.[^4] |
| **AI Capability Restrictions** | Anthropic (ASL-3), OpenAI, Google DeepMind | Output filtering and deployment restrictions for frontier AI models based on CBRN capability evaluations. |
| **Biosecurity Governance** | <EntityLink id="nti-bio">NTI Bio</EntityLink>, CSIS, Council on Strategic Risks | Strengthening the BWC, policy research on AI-enabled bioterrorism, dual-use research oversight.[^5] |
