Interpretability research aims to understand what AI systems are "thinking" and why they behave as they do.

**Overview:**
- **<EntityLink id="interpretability">Interpretability</EntityLink>**: The field and its importance for safety

**Mechanistic Approaches:**
- **<EntityLink id="mech-interp">Mechanistic Interpretability</EntityLink>**: Reverse-engineering neural networks
- **<EntityLink id="sparse-autoencoders">Sparse Autoencoders</EntityLink>**: Learning interpretable features
- **<EntityLink id="probing">Probing</EntityLink>**: Testing for specific knowledge or concepts
- **<EntityLink id="circuit-breakers">Circuit Breakers</EntityLink>**: Identifying and modifying specific circuits

**Representation-Based:**
- **<EntityLink id="representation-engineering">Representation Engineering</EntityLink>**: Controlling behavior via internal representations
