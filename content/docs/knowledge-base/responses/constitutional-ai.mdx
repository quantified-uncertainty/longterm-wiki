## Overview

Constitutional AI (CAI) is <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic's</EntityLink> groundbreaking methodology for training AI systems to be helpful, harmless, and honest using explicit constitutional principles rather than solely human feedback. Introduced in 2022, CAI has become one of the most influential approaches to <EntityLink id="E439">AI alignment</EntityLink>, demonstrating 3-10x improvements in harmlessness metrics while maintaining helpfulness across Anthropic's Claude model family.

The approach fundamentally shifts AI safety training from implicit human preferences to explicit, interpretable rules that guide model behavior. CAI's two-stage process—supervised learning with AI feedback followed by reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF)—has proven scalable and effective, influencing safety practices across major AI laboratories and informing ongoing debates about governance approaches to AI development.

## Risk Assessment & Impact

| Risk Category | Assessment | Key Metrics | Evidence Source |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Harmlessness Improvement** | High positive impact | 3-10x reduction in harmful outputs | <R id="683aef834ac1612a">Anthropic Constitutional AI Paper</R> |
| **Scalability** | Moderate success | Deployed across Claude 1, 2, and 3 | <R id="a2cf0d0271acb097">Anthropic Model Cards</R> |
| **Transparency** | High | Explicit constitutional principles | <R id="8f63dfa1697f2fa8">Anthropic Constitution</R> |
| **Generalizability** | Under evaluation | Limited third-party replication | <R id="132aaa63c43beb04">OpenAI <EntityLink id="E259">RLHF</EntityLink> comparisons</R> |

## Core Methodology

### Constitutional Principles

CAI operates on a written constitution containing principles like:

| Principle Category | Example Rules | Purpose |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Harm Prevention** | "Avoid content that could harm children" | Reduce dangerous outputs |
| **Truthfulness** | "Be honest and transparent about limitations" | Improve epistemic reliability |
| **Fairness** | "Avoid discriminatory language or bias" | Promote equitable treatment |
| **Privacy** | "Don't request or use personal information" | Protect user privacy |

### Two-Stage Training Process

| Stage | Method | Key Innovation | Outcome |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Stage 1: SL-CAI** | Supervised learning with AI critique | AI generates critiques and revisions | Self-improving constitutional adherence |
| **Stage 2: RL-CAI** | RLAIF using constitutional principles | AI preferences replace human raters | Scalable alignment without human bottleneck |

### How It Works

`} />

The two-stage process enables self-improvement without human labels. In Stage 1, the model learns to critique and revise its own outputs based on constitutional principles. In Stage 2, the model's constitutional judgments replace human preference labels for reinforcement learning, achieving comparable performance to RLHF while being significantly more cost-effective.

## Risks Addressed

| Risk | Relevance | How It Helps |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| <EntityLink id="E274">Scheming/Deceptive Alignment</EntityLink> | Medium | Explicit principles create auditable constraints; Constitutional Classifiers detect hidden intent |
| <EntityLink id="misuse-of-ai">AI Misuse</EntityLink> | High | Reduces harmful outputs by 3-10x; jailbreak success rate reduced from 86% to 4.4% with classifiers |
| <EntityLink id="value-lock-in">Value Lock-in</EntityLink> | Medium | Transparent, auditable constitutions enable iteration and governance oversight |
| <EntityLink id="E253">Reward Hacking</EntityLink> | Medium | Constitutional principles provide interpretable reward signal vs. opaque human preferences |

## Technical Implementation

### AI Feedback Generation

The CAI process involves:

- **Critique Generation**: AI identifies constitutional violations in responses
- **Revision Creation**: AI generates improved versions following constitutional principles  
- **Preference Modeling**: AI ranks responses based on constitutional adherence
- **Policy Training**: Final model learns from AI-generated preferences
