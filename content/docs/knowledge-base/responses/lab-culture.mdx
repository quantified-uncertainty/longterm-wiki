## Overview

Lab safety culture encompasses the practices, incentives, and governance structures within AI development organizations that influence how safely frontier AI systems are built and deployed. This includes safety team authority and resources, pre-deployment testing standards, internal governance mechanisms, and relationships with the external safety community.

The importance of lab culture stems from a simple reality: AI labs are where critical decisions happen. Even the best external regulations are implemented internally, and most safety-relevant decisions never reach regulators. Cultural factors determine whether safety concerns are surfaced, taken seriously, and acted upon before deployment.

Recent evidence suggests significant gaps in current practice. The [FLI Winter 2025 AI Safety Index](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-winter-2025/) evaluated eight leading AI companies across 35 indicators spanning six critical domains. No company scored higher than C+ overall (<EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink>: 2.3 GPA, <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>: 2.3 GPA), with <EntityLink id="deepmind">Google DeepMind</EntityLink> at C (2.0 GPA). Most concerning: 5 of 8 companies received F grades on existential safety, and none scored above D—the second consecutive report with such results. According to <R id="a74d9fdd24d82d24">SaferAI's 2025 assessment</R>, no AI company scored better than "weak" (under 35%) in risk management maturity. Meanwhile, <R id="21118f4612db1855">xAI released Grok 4 without any safety documentation</R>, and OpenAI has cycled through 4 Heads of Preparedness since 2024 as the company restructures its safety teams.

### Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Tractability | **Medium** | Culture change possible but historically difficult; 12 companies now have published safety policies |
| Current State | **Weak** | No company scored above C+ overall; all received D or F on existential safety (FLI Winter 2025) |
| Neglectedness | **Medium** | Significant attention but inside positions scarce; OpenAI has cycled through 3 Heads of Preparedness |
| Importance if Alignment Hard | **Critical** | Labs must take safety seriously for any technical solution to be implemented |
| Importance if Alignment Easy | **High** | Even easy alignment requires good practices for deployment and testing |
| Industry Coordination | **Moderate** | 20 companies signed Seoul commitments but xAI releases without safety reports |
| Whistleblower Protection | **Weak** | SEC complaint filed against OpenAI; AI WPA introduced May 2025 with bipartisan support (3R, 3D) |
| Safety Team Retention | **Low** | ~50% of OpenAI safety researchers departed in 2024 (14 of ≈30 staff) |
| Lab Differentiation | **Widening** | 2.0+ GPA gap between top 3 (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind) and rest (xAI, Meta, DeepSeek) |

## Risks Addressed

Lab safety culture is relevant to nearly all AI risks because labs are where decisions about development, deployment, and safety measures are made. Particularly relevant risks include:

| Risk | Relevance | How Culture Helps |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| <EntityLink id="racing-dynamics">Racing dynamics</EntityLink> | **High** | Culture determines whether labs slow down when safety warrants it |
| <EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment">Deceptive alignment</EntityLink> | **High** | Thorough evaluation culture needed to detect subtle misalignment |
| <EntityLink id="bioweapons">Bioweapons</EntityLink> | **High** | 3 of 7 labs test for dangerous bio capabilities; culture determines rigor |
| <EntityLink id="cyberweapons">Cyberweapons</EntityLink> | **High** | Similar to bio: culture determines evaluation thoroughness |
| <EntityLink id="concentration-of-power">Concentration of power</EntityLink> | **Medium** | Governance structures can constrain how power is used |

---

## How It Works

Lab safety culture operates through several interconnected mechanisms:

1. **Safety team authority**: When safety teams have genuine power to gate deployments, they can prevent rushed releases of potentially dangerous systems. This requires leadership buy-in and appropriate organizational structure.

2. **Evaluation rigor**: Culture determines how thoroughly models are tested before deployment. A culture that prioritizes speed may allocate insufficient time for safety testing (e.g., reports of GPT-4o receiving less than a week for safety testing).

3. **Whistleblower protection**: Employees who identify safety concerns must be able to raise them without fear of retaliation. The OpenAI NDA controversy illustrates how restrictive agreements can suppress internal dissent.

4. **Industry coordination**: Through mechanisms like the <EntityLink id="frontier-model-forum">Frontier Model Forum</EntityLink>, labs can coordinate on safety standards. However, coordination is fragile when any lab can defect for competitive advantage.

5. **External accountability**: Government testing agreements (like the <EntityLink id="us-aisi">US AI Safety Institute</EntityLink> MOUs) create external checkpoints that can compensate for internal culture weaknesses.

## Components of Lab Safety Culture

Lab safety culture encompasses multiple interconnected elements that together determine how safely AI systems are developed and deployed.

### What This Includes

- **Safety team resources and authority** - Budget allocation, headcount, and decision-making power
- **Pre-deployment testing standards** - Capability evaluations, red-teaming, and safety thresholds
- **Publication and release decisions** - Who decides what to deploy and on what basis
- **Internal governance structures** - Board oversight, safety committees, escalation paths
- **Hiring and promotion incentives** - What behaviors and priorities get rewarded
- **Whistleblower protections** - Ability to raise concerns without retaliation
- **Relationships with external safety community** - Transparency, collaboration, information sharing

### Key Levers for Improvement

| Lever | Mechanism | Who Influences | Current Status |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Safety team authority | Gate deployment decisions, veto power | Lab leadership | Variable; some teams disbanded |
| Pre-deployment evals | Capability thresholds trigger safeguards | Safety teams, external evaluators | 3 of 7 major labs test for dangerous capabilities |
| Board governance | Independent oversight of critical decisions | Board members, investors, trustees | Anthropic has Long-Term Benefit Trust; OpenAI restructuring |
| Responsible disclosure | Share safety findings across industry | Industry norms, Frontier Model Forum | 12 companies published safety policies |
| Researcher culture | Prioritize safety work, reward caution | Hiring practices, promotion criteria | Concerns about departures signal cultural issues |
| External accountability | Third-party audits, government testing | Regulators, <EntityLink id="ai-safety-institutes">AI Safety Institutes</EntityLink> | US/UK AISIs signed MOUs with labs in 2024 |
| Whistleblower protection | Legal protections for raising concerns | Legislators, courts | AI WPA introduced 2024; OpenAI voided restrictive NDAs |

## How Lab Culture Influences Safety Outcomes

Lab safety culture operates through multiple channels that together determine whether safety concerns translate into safer AI systems.

## Current State of Lab Safety Culture

### Safety Policy Assessments (Winter 2025)

The [FLI Winter 2025 AI Safety Index](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-winter-2025/) evaluated eight leading AI companies across 35 indicators spanning six critical domains. This is a notable independent assessment of lab safety practices.

| Company | FLI Overall | Existential Safety | Information Sharing | Risk Assessment | Safety Framework |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Anthropic | **C+** | D | A | B | RSP v2.2 (May 2025) |
| OpenAI | **C+** | D | A | B | Preparedness Framework |
| Google DeepMind | **C** | D | B | B | FSF v3.0 (Sep 2025) |
| xAI | **D** | D- | F | F | Published Dec 2024 |
| Meta | **D** | D | C | D | FAIR Safety Policy |
| DeepSeek | **D-** | F | F | F | None published |
| Alibaba Cloud | **D-** | F | F | F | None published |
| Z.ai | **D-** | F | F | F | None published |

**Key findings from the [FLI Winter 2025 assessment](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-winter-2025/):**
- No company scored higher than C+ overall (maximum 2.3 GPA on 4.0 scale)
- 5 of 8 companies received F on existential safety; no company exceeded D—the second consecutive report with such results
- 2.0+ GPA gap between top 3 (Anthropic/OpenAI at 2.3, DeepMind at 2.0) and bottom 5 (xAI at 1.0, Meta/DeepSeek/Alibaba/Z.ai below 1.0)
- Chinese labs (DeepSeek, Z.ai, Alibaba) received failing marks for not publishing any safety framework
- MIT professor Max Tegmark noted companies "lack a plan for safely managing" superintelligence despite explicitly pursuing it
- Eight independent expert reviewers assigned domain-level grades (A-F) with written justifications

**Key findings from <R id="a74d9fdd24d82d24">SaferAI's assessment</R>:**
- No company scored better than "weak" in risk management maturity
- SaferAI labeled current safety regimes as "weak to very weak" and "unacceptable"
- Only 3 of 7 firms conduct substantive testing for dangerous capabilities (bio/cyber)
- One reviewer called the disconnect between AGI timelines and safety planning "deeply disturbing"

### Safety Team Departures and Restructuring (2024-2025)

The departure of safety-focused staff from major labs—particularly OpenAI—provides evidence about the state of lab culture. According to former team member Daniel Kokotajlo, approximately 50% of OpenAI's safety researchers (roughly 14 of 30 team members) departed throughout 2024, leaving a reduced workforce of 16. OpenAI has now cycled through multiple Heads of Preparedness, and the pattern of departures continues.

| Metric | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|-------|
| OpenAI safety team size | ≈30 | ≈16 | Unknown | -47% in 2024 |
| Major safety team disbandments | 0 | 2 | 0 | Superalignment + AGI Readiness |
| Head of Preparedness turnover | 1 | 3 | 1+ | High turnover |
| C-suite departures at OpenAI | 0 | 5+ | — | Murati, McGrew, Zoph, etc. |
| Anthropic safety hires from OpenAI | — | 3+ | — | Brain drain pattern |

| Departure | Former Role | New Position | Stated Concerns |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Ilya Sutskever | Chief Scientist, OpenAI | Safe Superintelligence Inc. | Left June 2024 to focus on safe AI |
| Jan Leike | Co-lead Superalignment, OpenAI | Co-lead Alignment Science, Anthropic | "<R id="a81e03bd4f8afca2">Safety culture has taken a backseat to shiny products</R>" |
| John Schulman | Co-founder, OpenAI | Anthropic | Wanted to return to alignment technical work |
| Miles Brundage | Head of AGI Readiness, OpenAI | Departed Oct 2024 | AGI Readiness team dissolved |
| Rosie Campbell | Policy Frontiers Lead, OpenAI | Departed 2024 | Cited dissolution of AGI Readiness team |
| Aleksander Madry | Head of Preparedness, OpenAI | Reassigned to AI reasoning | Role turnover |
| Lilian Weng | Acting Head of Preparedness | Departed mid-2025 | Brief tenure |
| Joaquin Quinonero Candela | Acting Head of Preparedness | Moved to lead recruiting (July 2025) | Role turnover |

Jan Leike's statement at departure remains notable: "Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor... But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products."

**2025 developments:** OpenAI is [now hiring a new Head of Preparedness](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/28/openai-is-looking-for-a-new-head-of-preparedness/) after the previous three holders either departed or were reassigned. CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that "potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025" along with other "real challenges."

### Rushed Deployment Concerns

Reports indicate OpenAI <R id="0a8da5fe117a4c50">rushed through GPT-4o's launch</R>, allocating less than a week to safety testing. Sources indicated the company sent invitations for the product's launch celebration before the safety team completed their tests.

### xAI Grok 4: A Case Study in Minimal Safety Practice

In July 2025, <R id="21118f4612db1855">xAI released Grok 4 without any system card</R>—the industry-standard safety report that other leading labs publish for major model releases. This occurred despite Elon Musk's long-standing warnings about AI dangers and despite xAI conducting dangerous capability evaluations.

| Aspect | xAI Practice | Industry Standard |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| System card | None published | Published before/at release |
| Dangerous capability evals | Conducted but undisclosed | Published with mitigations |
| Pre-deployment safety review | Unknown | Required by Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind |
| External audits | None reported | Multiple labs use third parties |
| Biosafety testing | Tested, found dangerous capabilities | Test + mitigate + disclose |

**Key concerns raised by researchers:**
- Samuel Marks (Anthropic) called the lack of safety reporting "reckless" and a break from "industry best practices"
- Boaz Barak (OpenAI, on leave from Harvard) stated the approach is "completely irresponsible"
- Dan Hendrycks (xAI Safety Adviser, CAIS Director) confirmed dangerous capability evaluations were conducted but results remain undisclosed
- Testing revealed Grok 4 was willing to assist with cultivation of plague bacteria under conditions of "limited resources"

The xAI case illustrates the fragility of voluntary safety commitments. Despite xAI publishing a safety framework in December 2024 and signing Seoul Summit commitments, the actual release of Grok 4 involved none of the documentation that other leading labs provide. As the [AI Lab Watch assessment](https://ailabwatch.substack.com/p/xais-new-safety-framework-is-dreadful) noted, xAI's framework states that "mitigations, not eval results, are load-bearing for safety"—meaning they rely on guardrails rather than ensuring models lack dangerous capabilities.

## Whistleblower Protections and Internal Voice

### Quantified State of Whistleblower Environment

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| SEC whistleblower tips received (2022) | 12,000+ | [SEC Annual Report 2022](https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower) |
| % of SEC award recipients who first raised concerns internally | ≈75% | SEC 2021 Annual Report |
| Estimated value of Kokotajlo's equity at stake | ≈\$1.7M | Fortune interview 2024 |
| OpenAI employees who signed "Right to Warn" letter | 9 | Open letter June 2024 |
| AI labs whose employees expressed worry about employer safety approach | 4+ | Anonymous 2024 survey |
| AI WPA co-sponsors (bipartisan) | 6 | 3 Republican, 3 Democratic |
| TFAIA revenue threshold for applicability | \$100M+ | Only applies to frontier developers |

### The OpenAI NDA Controversy

In 2024, OpenAI faced significant controversy over restrictive employment agreements:

**Timeline of events:**
1. **May 2024:** News broke that OpenAI pressured departing employees to sign contracts with extremely broad nondisparagement provisions or lose vested equity
2. **July 2024:** Anonymous whistleblowers <R id="ed8b161851bc498b">filed an SEC complaint</R> alleging violations of Rule 21F-17(a) and the Dodd-Frank Act
3. **July 2024:** 13 current and former employees from OpenAI and Google DeepMind posted "<R id="7df8d480e414aa70">A Right to Warn About Advanced Artificial Intelligence</R>"
4. **August 2024:** Senator Grassley sent <R id="67cbb636aee227a3">letter to Sam Altman</R> requesting documentation
5. **2024:** OpenAI <R id="a0e42d8456793900">voided non-disparagement terms</R> in response to pressure

**Key allegations from the SEC complaint:**
- Agreements required employees to waive federal whistleblower compensation rights
- Required prior company consent before disclosing information to federal authorities
- Non-disparagement clauses lacked exemptions for SEC disclosures
- Violated Dodd-Frank Act protections for securities law whistleblowers

### The "Right to Warn" Letter

The open letter from AI employees stated: "Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated."

### Legislative Response

The <R id="2ae7df16aad64338">AI Whistleblower Protection Act (AI WPA)</R> was [introduced on May 15, 2025](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/grassley-introduces-ai-whistleblower-protection-act) with bipartisan support:
- Sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) with co-sponsors Coons (D-DE), Blackburn (R-TN), Klobuchar (D-MN), Hawley (R-MO), and Schatz (D-HI)
- Companion legislation introduced by Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.)
- Provides remedies including job restoration, 2x back wages, and damages compensation
- Limits protections to disclosures about "substantial and specific dangers" to public safety, health, or national security
- Makes contractual waivers of whistleblower rights unenforceable, including forced arbitration clauses

### The OpenAI Files Report (June 2025)

In June 2025, two nonprofit watchdogs (The Midas Project and Tech Oversight Project) released <R id="85ba042a002437a0">"The OpenAI Files"</R>, described as the most comprehensive collection of publicly documented concerns about governance, leadership integrity, and organizational culture at OpenAI.

**Key findings from the report:**
- Documented pattern of broken promises on safety and transparency commitments
- OpenAI failed to release a system card for Deep Research when first made available—described as "the most significant model release I can think of that was released without any safety information"
- In 2023, a hacker gained access to OpenAI internal messages and stole details about AI technology; the company did not inform authorities, and the breach wasn't public for over a year
- Whistleblower allegations that restrictive agreements could penalize workers who raised concerns to federal regulators

The report calls for maintaining profit caps, ensuring primacy of OpenAI's safety mission, and implementing robust oversight mechanisms. While produced with complete editorial independence (no funding from OpenAI competitors), it highlights systemic governance concerns that compound the safety culture issues documented elsewhere.

## Industry Coordination Mechanisms

### Frontier Model Forum

Established in July 2023, the <R id="51e8802a5aef29f6">Frontier Model Forum</R> serves as the primary industry coordination body:

**Members:** Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI (founding), plus additional companies

**Key activities in 2024:**
- Announced \$10 million AI Safety Fund with philanthropic partners
- Published "<R id="5329d38ad33971ff">Early Best Practices for Frontier AI Safety Evaluations</R>" (July 2024)
- Established biosecurity standing group with researchers from academia, industry, and government
- Produced common definition of "red teaming" with shared case studies

### Seoul Summit Commitments

In May 2024, <R id="c7bf226bdc483bf6">16 companies committed to publish frontier AI safety protocols</R>:
- All Frontier Model Forum members signed
- 4 additional companies joined subsequently (total: 20)
- Commitments require publishing safety frameworks before Paris AI Action Summit (February 2025)

**Current status (as of Winter 2025):** 12 of 20 companies (60%) have published policies: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Magic, Naver, Meta, G42, Cohere, Microsoft, Amazon, xAI, and NVIDIA. This represents a 40% non-compliance rate 9+ months after the Seoul commitments.

### Government Testing Agreements

In <R id="627bb42e8f74be04">August 2024, the U.S. AI Safety Institute signed MOUs</R> with Anthropic and OpenAI:
- Framework for AISI to receive access to major new models before and after public release
- Enables collaborative research on capability and safety risk evaluation
- AISI will provide feedback on potential safety improvements
- Collaboration with UK AI Safety Institute

Jack Clark (Anthropic): "Third-party testing is a really important part of the AI ecosystem... This work with the US AISI will build on earlier work we did this year, where we worked with the UK AISI to do a pre-deployment test on Sonnet 3.5."

## Corporate Governance Structures

Different AI labs have adopted different governance structures to balance commercial pressures with safety commitments:

### Anthropic's Structure

<R id="d7ac30b45b4da216">Anthropic is structured as a Public Benefit Corporation</R> with additional governance layers:
- **Board accountability:** Board is accountable to shareholders (Google and Amazon have invested approximately \$1 billion combined)
- **Long-Term Benefit Trust:** Separate trust with 5 financially disinterested members will select most board members over time
- **Trust mandate:** Focus on AI safety and long-term benefit of humanity
- **Responsible Scaling Officer:** Jared Kaplan (Chief Science Officer) serves as RSP officer, succeeding Sam McCandlish
- **Anonymous compliance reporting:** Internal process for staff to notify RSO of potential noncompliance

**2025 RSP developments:** Anthropic updated their [Responsible Scaling Policy to version 2.2](https://www.anthropic.com/responsible-scaling-policy) in May 2025 and [activated ASL-3 protections](https://www.anthropic.com/news/activating-asl3-protections) for Claude Opus 4—the first activation of the highest safety tier for any commercial model. ASL-3 involves increased internal security measures against model weight theft and targeted deployment measures limiting risk of CBRN weapons development. Claude Opus 4.5 was also released under ASL-3 after evaluation determined it did not cross the ASL-4 threshold. Despite leading competitors on safety metrics, Dario Amodei has publicly estimated a 25% chance that AI development goes "really, really badly."

| ASL Level | Security Standard | Deployment Standard | Current Models |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| ASL-2 | Defense against opportunistic weight theft | Training to refuse dangerous CBRN requests | Claude 3.5 Sonnet and earlier |
| ASL-3 | Defense against sophisticated non-state attackers | Multi-layer monitoring, rapid response, narrow CBRN refusals | Claude Opus 4, Claude 4.5 |
| ASL-4 | Not yet defined | Not yet defined | None (threshold not yet reached) |

### OpenAI's Structure

<R id="8ffc465752f15d66">OpenAI is transitioning from a capped-profit structure</R>:
- **Current:** Capped-profit LLC under nonprofit board
- **Transition:** Moving to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)
- **Nonprofit role:** Will continue to control the PBC and become a major shareholder
- **Stated rationale:** PBCs are standard for other AGI labs (Anthropic, xAI)

**October 2025 restructuring:** Following regulatory approval from California and Delaware, the nonprofit <EntityLink id="openai-foundation">OpenAI Foundation</EntityLink> now holds 26% of the for-profit OpenAI Group PBC, with Microsoft holding 27% and employees/other investors holding 47%. The Safety and Security Committee (SSC) remains a committee of the Foundation (not the for-profit), theoretically insulating safety decisions from commercial pressure. However, critics note that J. Zico Kolter (SSC chair) appears on the Group board only as an observer. See the <EntityLink id="openai-foundation">OpenAI Foundation</EntityLink> page for detailed analysis of this structure's implications.

| OpenAI Ownership Structure (Oct 2025) | Stake |
|---------------------------------------|-------|
| OpenAI Foundation (nonprofit) | 26% |
| Microsoft | 27% |
| Employees and other investors | 47% |

### Google DeepMind's Structure

Google DeepMind operates as a division of Alphabet with internal governance bodies:
- **Responsibility and Safety Council (RSC):** Co-chaired by COO Lila Ibrahim and VP Responsibility Helen King
- **AGI Safety Council:** Led by Co-Founder and Chief AGI Scientist Shane Legg, works closely with RSC
- **Safety case reviews:** Required before external deployment and for large-scale internal rollouts once models hit certain capability thresholds

**September 2025: <R id="a5154ccbf034e273">Frontier Safety Framework v3.0</R>:** The third iteration introduced new Critical Capability Levels (CCLs) focused on harmful manipulation—specifically, AI models that could systematically and substantially change beliefs. The framework now expands safety reviews to cover scenarios where models may resist human shutdown or control. This represents a significant evolution from the original FSF, addressing misalignment risk more directly.

### Governance Effectiveness

Harvard Law School's Roberto Tallarita notes both structures "are highly unusual for cutting-edge tech companies. Their purpose is to isolate corporate governance from the pressures of profit maximization and to constrain the power of the CEO."

However, critics argue independent safety functions at board level have proved ineffective, and that real oversight requires government regulation rather than corporate governance innovations.

## Key Cruxes

### Crux 1: Can Labs Self-Regulate?

| Evidence For Self-Regulation | Evidence Against |
|------------------------------|------------------|
| 12 labs published safety policies (60% compliance rate) | No company scored above "weak" (less than 35%) in risk management |
| Frontier Model Forum coordinates on safety (4 founding members, 20+ total) | Critics argue RSP 2.2 reduced transparency vs. 1.0 |
| Government testing agreements signed (US/UK AISI MOUs) | OpenAI removed third-party audit commitment |
| \$10M AI Safety Fund established | ~50% of OpenAI safety staff departed in 2024 (≈14 of 30) |
| Anthropic activated ASL-3 protections for Claude Opus 4 | GPT-4o reportedly received less than 1 week for safety testing |

**Assessment:** Evidence is mixed but concerning. Labs have created safety infrastructure, but competitive pressure repeatedly overrides safety commitments. The pattern of safety team departures and policy weakening suggests self-regulation has significant limits.

### Crux 2: Do Inside Positions Help?

| Evidence For Inside Positions | Evidence Against |
|------------------------------|------------------|
| Inside researchers can influence specific decisions | Departures suggest limited influence on priorities |
| Access to models enables better safety research | Selection may favor agreeable employees |
| Relationships enable informal influence | Restrictive NDAs limited public speech |
| Some safety research is only possible inside | Captured by lab interests over time |

**Assessment:** Inside positions likely provide some value but face significant constraints. The question is whether marginal influence on specific decisions outweighs the cost of operating within an organization whose priorities may conflict with safety.

### Crux 3: Can Labs Coordinate?

| Evidence For Coordination | Evidence Against |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| 20 companies signed Seoul commitments | 40% non-compliance rate on policy publication after 9+ months |
| Frontier Model Forum active since July 2023 | DeepMind will only implement some policies if other labs do |
| Joint safety research publications | Racing dynamics create first-mover advantages worth billions |
| Shared definitions and best practices (e.g., red-teaming) | Labs can drop safety measures if competitors don't adopt them |

**Assessment:** Coordination mechanisms exist but are fragile. The "<R id="a37628e3a1e97778">footnote 17 problem</R>"—where labs reserve the right to drop safety measures if competitors don't adopt them—undermines the value of voluntary coordination.

---

## Who Should Work on This?

**Strong fit if you believe:**
- Labs are where critical decisions happen and inside influence matters
- Culture can meaningfully change with the right people and incentives
- External regulation will take time and internal pressure is a bridge
- You can maintain safety priorities while working within lab constraints

**Less relevant if you believe:**
- Labs structurally cannot prioritize safety over profit
- Inside positions compromise independent judgment
- External policy and regulation are more leveraged
- Lab culture will only change through external pressure

## AI Transition Model Context

Lab safety culture improves the <EntityLink id="ai-transition-model" /> through <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" />:

| Factor | Parameter | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="safety-culture-strength" /> | Internal norms determine whether safety concerns are taken seriously before deployment |
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="human-oversight-quality" /> | Safety team authority and resources affect oversight effectiveness |
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="alignment-robustness" /> | Pre-deployment testing standards catch failures before release |

Current state is concerning: no company scored above C+ overall (FLI Winter 2025), all received D or below on existential safety, and ~50% of OpenAI safety staff departed amid rushed deployments.
