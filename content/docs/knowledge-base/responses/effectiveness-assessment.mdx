## Executive Summary

As artificial intelligence governance efforts proliferate globally—from the <EntityLink id="eu-ai-act">EU AI Act</EntityLink> to <EntityLink id="voluntary-commitments">voluntary industry commitments</EntityLink>—a fundamental question emerges: **Which policies are actually working to reduce AI risks?** 

Our analysis reveals substantial variation in policy effectiveness across approaches:
- **Compute thresholds and export controls** achieve 60-75% compliance rates where measured
- **Voluntary commitments** show less than 30% substantive behavioral change despite 85%+ paper compliance
- **Mandatory disclosure requirements** demonstrate 40-70% compliance but often lack enforcement teeth
- **Only 15-20% of AI policies worldwide** have established measurable outcome data

The field faces a critical evidence crisis: fewer than 20% of evaluations meet moderate evidence standards, most policies are too new for meaningful assessment, and genuine risk reduction remains largely unmeasured across all policy types.

## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Overall Effectiveness** | Low-Moderate (30-45%) | Only 15-20% of AI policies have measurable outcome data; [AGILE Index 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11546) evaluates 40 countries across 43 indicators, finding wide variance |
| **Evidence Quality** | Weak | Fewer than 20% of evaluations meet moderate evidence standards; [OECD 2025 report](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287.html) notes "very little research on risks of AI in policy evaluation" |
| **Implementation Maturity** | Early Stage | <EntityLink id="eu-ai-act">EU AI Act</EntityLink> first full enforcement powers granted December 2025 (Finland); most frameworks still in pilot phases |

## Overview

By May 2023, [over 1,000 AI policy initiatives](https://oecd.ai/en/) had been reported across 70+ jurisdictions following OECD AI Principles, yet systematic effectiveness data remains scarce. The stakes of this assessment are enormous: with limited political capital, regulatory bandwidth, and industry cooperation available for <EntityLink id="ai-governance">AI governance</EntityLink>, policymakers must allocate these scarce resources toward approaches that demonstrably improve outcomes.

Current evaluation efforts face severe limitations: most AI policies are less than two years old, providing insufficient time to observe meaningful effects; counterfactual scenarios are unknowable; and "success" itself remains contested across different stakeholder priorities of safety, innovation, and rights protection. Early [OECD research](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2025/06/governing-with-artificial-intelligence_398fa287.html) suggests that inconsistent governance approaches could cost firms 8-9% in underperformance.

Despite these challenges, emerging evidence suggests significant variation in policy effectiveness. Export controls and <EntityLink id="compute-governance">compute thresholds</EntityLink> appear to achieve 60-70% compliance rates where measured, while voluntary commitments show less than 30% behavioral change. However, only 15-20% of AI policies worldwide have established measurable outcome data, creating a critical evidence gap that undermines informed governance decisions.

## How Policy Effectiveness Assessment Works

Policy effectiveness assessment in AI governance operates through a systematic process that moves from policy design through implementation to impact measurement:

**Step 1: Baseline Establishment** - Before implementation, assessment requires clear baselines measuring current industry behavior, risk levels, and compliance patterns. This baseline serves as the counterfactual against which policy effects are measured.

**Step 2: Implementation Monitoring** - As policies take effect, assessment tracks both formal compliance (whether regulated entities follow rules on paper) and behavioral compliance (whether underlying practices actually change). This includes monitoring for unintended consequences like regulatory arbitrage or innovation displacement.

**Step 3: Outcome Measurement** - The critical phase involves measuring whether policy compliance translates into actual risk reduction. This requires sophisticated metrics connecting regulatory activity to safety outcomes, often involving longitudinal studies over 3-5 year periods.

**Step 4: Comparative Analysis** - Effective assessment compares outcomes across different jurisdictions, policy approaches, and time periods to identify which interventions produce superior results under varying conditions.

**Step 5: Adaptive Refinement** - Based on evidence, policymakers either iterate on successful approaches, abandon ineffective ones, or modify implementation based on observed gaps between intended and actual outcomes.

The assessment process faces particular challenges in AI contexts: rapid technological change can make policies obsolete before effects are measurable, international competition creates strategic incentives for jurisdictions to claim success regardless of evidence, and the global nature of AI development enables sophisticated actors to route around regulations.

## Assessment Framework and Methodology

### Effectiveness Dimensions

Evaluating AI policy effectiveness requires examining multiple interconnected dimensions that capture different aspects of policy success. **Compliance assessment** measures whether regulated entities actually follow established rules, using metrics like audit results and violation rates. **Behavioral change analysis** goes deeper to examine whether policies alter underlying conduct beyond mere rule-following, tracking indicators like safety investments and practice adoption. **Risk reduction measurement** attempts to quantify whether policies genuinely lower AI-related risks through tracking incidents, near-misses, and capability constraints.

Additionally, **side effect evaluation** captures unintended consequences including innovation impacts and geographic development shifts, while **durability analysis** assesses whether policy effects will persist over time through measures of industry acceptance and political stability. This multidimensional framework recognizes that apparent compliance may mask ineffective implementation, while genuine behavioral change represents a stronger signal of policy success.

### Evidence Quality Standards

The field employs varying evidence standards that significantly impact assessment reliability. **Strong evidence** emerges from randomized controlled trials (extremely rare in AI policy contexts) and clear before-after comparisons with appropriate control groups. **Moderate evidence** includes compliance audits, enforcement data, observable industry behavior changes, and structured expert assessments. **Weak evidence** relies on anecdotal reports, stated intentions without verification, and theoretical arguments about likely effects.

Current AI policy assessment suffers from overreliance on weak evidence categories, with fewer than 20% of evaluations meeting moderate evidence standards. This evidence hierarchy suggests treating most current effectiveness claims with significant skepticism while investing heavily in building stronger evaluation infrastructure.

This framework reveals critical failure modes where policies appear successful based on stated intentions or compliance paperwork, but fail to generate measurable behavioral change or risk reduction. The gap between policy announcement and actual safety impact often spans multiple years, during which ineffective approaches consume scarce governance resources.

## Comprehensive Policy Effectiveness Analysis

### Enforcement Action Trends (2024-2025)

Recent enforcement data reveals significant activity but variable effectiveness across jurisdictions:

| Enforcement Initiative | Scope | Actions Taken | Effectiveness Indicators | Source |
|----------------------|--------|---------------|------------------------|--------|
| **FTC Operation AI Comply** | Consumer-facing AI practices | Multiple investigations launched | Focus on data retention, security practices, third-party transfers | [ThinkBRG (2024)](https://www.thinkbrg.com/insights/publications/privacy-and-ai-in-the-hot-seat-what-2024s-enforcement-trends-reveal-about-compliance-priorities/) |
| **SEC AI Task Force** | Financial AI applications | Chief AI Officer role created; 2025 AI Compliance Plan published | Systematic regulatory approach emerging | [Alvarez & Marsal (2025)](https://www.alvarezandmarsal.com/thought-leadership/ai-litigation-enforcement-and-compliance-risk-q4-2025-regulatory-update) |
| **FTC AI Chatbot Inquiry** | Consumer chatbot practices | September 2025 inquiry launched | Investigation ongoing; compliance changes expected | [Alvarez & Marsal (2025)](https://www.alvarezandmarsal.com/thought-leadership/ai-litigation-enforcement-and-compliance-risk-q4-2025-regulatory-update) |
| **NYC Local Law 144 Enforcement** | AI hiring tools | DCWP identified 1/17+ violations | Enforcement failure: 94% violation miss rate | [NY State Comptroller (2025)](https://www.osc.ny.gov/state-agencies/audits/2025/12/02/enforcement-local-law-144-automated-employment-decision-tools) |

The enforcement pattern suggests federal agencies are developing systematic AI oversight capabilities, while local enforcement faces significant capacity constraints.

### AI Safety Institute Performance Comparison

International AI safety institutes show varying approaches and early results:

| Country/Region | Institute | Establishment Date | Key Capabilities | Early Results | Assessment |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **United States** | <EntityLink id="us-aisi">US AI Safety Institute (NIST)</EntityLink> | February 2024 | 280+ consortium members, 5 working groups, model access agreements | Evaluation frameworks developing, pre-deployment testing protocols | Building capacity but authority unclear |
| **United Kingdom** | UK AI Safety Institute | November 2023 | Focus on frontier model evaluation, international coordination | Model evaluation capabilities, safety research partnerships | Technical leadership but limited enforcement |
| **European Union** | EU AI Office | 2024 | AI Act enforcement, international coordination, risk assessment | AI Pact voluntary compliance initiative | Regulatory authority but implementation early |
| **Singapore** | AI Verify Foundation | 2022 | Industry standards, testing frameworks, certification | 200+ organizations engaged, Model AI Governance framework | Strong industry engagement, limited scope |

[Future of Life Institute's 2025 AI Safety Index](https://futureoflife.org/ai-safety-index-summer-2025/) found that capabilities are accelerating faster than risk management practices across all evaluated institutes, with <EntityLink id="anthropic">Anthropic</EntityLink> receiving the highest grade (C+) among companies for leading on risk assessments and safety benchmarks.

### EU AI Act Compliance Cost Analysis

Implementation costs for the EU AI Act reveal significant variation based on company size and risk category:

| Cost Category | Large Enterprise | SME | Basis | Source |
|---------------|------------------|-----|-------|--------|
| **Quality Management System Setup** | €500K-1M | €193K-330K | Initial QMS implementation for high-risk systems | [CEPS (2024)](https://www.ceps.eu/clarifying-the-costs-for-the-eus-ai-act/) |
| **Ongoing Compliance** | 17% of AI spending | 17% of AI spending | Annual overhead for non-compliant companies | [CEPS (2024)](https://www.ceps.eu/clarifying-the-costs-for-the-eus-ai-act/) |
| **Global Industry Total** | €1.6-3.3 billion | N/A | Total compliance costs assuming 10% high-risk systems | [2021.ai (2024)](https://2021.ai/news/understanding-the-eu-ai-act-penalties-and-achieving-regulatory-compliance) |
| **Risk Assessment** | Variable | Variable | Only 10% of AI systems expected subject to costs | [European Commission](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/) |

Critical insight: The [CEPS analysis](https://www.ceps.eu/clarifying-the-costs-for-the-eus-ai-act/) notes that the 17% compliance cost estimate "only applies to companies that don't fulfill any regulatory requirements as business-as-usual," suggesting costs may be lower for companies with existing governance frameworks.

### Private Governance Mechanism Effectiveness

Industry-led governance shows mixed results with significant gaps:

| Mechanism Type | Examples | Adoption Rate | Effectiveness Indicators | Limitations |
|----------------|----------|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Professional Certification** | [IAPP AIGP certification](https://iapp.org/certify/aigp) | Growing demand | Training programs proliferating | Questions whether certifications demonstrate actual competence |
| **Industry Standards** | ISO/IEC standards, IEEE frameworks | Variable by sector | Framework development active | Limited enforcement mechanisms |
| **Third-Party Auditing** | AI audit firms, assessment services | Expanding market | NYC hiring law created audit industry | Audit quality varies dramatically |
| **Voluntary Commitments** | <EntityLink id="voluntary-commitments">Company RSPs</EntityLink>, White House commitments | High stated adoption | Paper compliance 85%+, behavioral change \<30% | No enforcement, competitive pressure erodes commitments |

[CSO Online (2024)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2097554/ai-governance-and-cybersecurity-certifications-are-they-worth-it.html) analysis suggests proliferation of AI governance certification programs reflects genuine demand for expertise, but questions remain about whether certifications correlate with actual competence improvements.

## Comparative Policy Effectiveness

The following table synthesizes available evidence on major AI governance approaches, revealing substantial variation in measured outcomes and highlighting critical evidence gaps:

| Policy Approach | Compliance Rate | Behavioral Change | Risk Reduction Evidence | Implementation Cost | Key Limitations | Evidence Quality |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Compute Thresholds** (e.g., EO 14110 10^26 FLOP) | 70-85% | Moderate (reporting infrastructure established) | Unknown (too early) | Low (automated reporting) | Threshold gaming; efficiency improvements undermine fixed FLOP limits | Moderate |
| **Export Controls** (semiconductor restrictions) | 60-75% | High (delayed Chinese AI capabilities 1-3 years) | Low-Moderate (workarounds proliferating) | High (diplomatic costs) | Unilateral controls enable regulatory arbitrage; accelerates domestic alternatives | Moderate |
| **Voluntary Commitments** (White House AI Commitments) | 85%+ adoption | Low (less than 30% substantive behavioral change) | Very Low (primarily aspirational) | Very Low | No enforcement; competitive pressure erodes commitments | Weak |
| **Mandatory Disclosure** (NYC Local Law 144) | 40-60% initial; improving to 70%+ | Moderate (20% abandoned AI tools rather than audit) | Unknown (audit quality varies dramatically) | Medium | Compliance without substance; specialized audit industry emerges | Moderate |
| **Risk-Based Frameworks** (EU AI Act) | Too early (phased implementation through 2027) | Too early | Too early | Very High (administrative burden) | Classification disputes; enforcement capacity untested | Insufficient data |
| **AI Safety Institutes** (US/UK AISIs) | N/A (institutional capacity) | Early (evaluation frameworks developing) | Too early (3-5 year assessment needed) | High | Independence questions; technical authority unclear | Weak |
| **Pre-deployment Evaluations** (Frontier lab RSPs) | High (major labs implementing) | Moderate (evaluation rigor varies) | Low (self-policing model) | Medium | No external verification; proprietary methods | Weak |
| **Liability Frameworks** | Early development | Unknown | Unknown | High (insurance requirements) | Limited implementation; unclear coverage scope | Insufficient data |

**Key findings:** Enforcement mechanisms and objective criteria strongly predict compliance, while voluntary approaches show minimal behavioral change under competitive pressure. However, genuine risk reduction remains largely unmeasured across all policy types, with most assessment timelines insufficient for meaningful evaluation.

### Political Economy Factors

Political durability analysis reveals significant vulnerabilities in AI policy effectiveness:

**Electoral Transitions**: The [Biden AI Diffusion Rule rescission](https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/us-chip-export-controls-china-ai) in March 2025 demonstrates how policy changes create continuity risks. [Carnegie Endowment research (January 2026)](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2026/01/ai-and-democracy-mapping-the-intersections?lang=en) identifies "high levels of public concern about effect of AI on political climate and election cycles."

**Democratic Accountability Challenges**: [Frontiers in Political Science (2025)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/political-science/articles/10.3389/fpos.2025.1504520/full) research on AI in political decision-making identifies a "double delegation problem" where accountability becomes ambiguous when AI systems influence governance decisions.

**Regulatory Capture**: Industry influence on voluntary frameworks raises concerns about whether private governance mechanisms serve public interests or facilitate capture of regulatory processes.

### Measurement Methodologies for Risk Reduction

Quantitative approaches to measuring AI risk reduction are emerging but remain underdeveloped:

**Key AI Risk Indicators (KAIRI) Framework**: [ScienceDirect research (August 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423017220) introduced the first systematic framework mapping regulatory requirements into four measurable principles: Sustainability, Accuracy, Fairness, and Explainability, with statistical metrics for each.

**Six-Step Risk Modeling**: [arXiv methodology (December 2025)](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.08864v1) provides quantitative modeling for cybersecurity risks from AI misuse, emphasizing that "publishing specific numbers enables experts to pinpoint disagreements and collectively refine estimates."

**Integrated Reporting Systems**: [EA Forum analysis (January 2025)](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CwQs8tKbEqAjprhb2/thoughts-about-policy-ecosystems-the-missing-links-in-ai) identifies "missing standardized ways to measure and report AI risks" and suggests adapting Corporate Social Responsibility reporting frameworks to AI governance contexts.

### Limitations of Current Approaches

Six critical limitations undermine current policy effectiveness assessment:

1. **Temporal Mismatch**: Most AI policies are 12-24 months old, while meaningful behavioral and safety effects require 3-5 years to manifest, creating systematic underestimation of policy impacts.

2. **Measurement Infrastructure Gaps**: Only 15-20% of AI policies worldwide have established measurable outcome metrics, with most assessments relying on input measures (compliance paperwork) rather than output measures (actual risk reduction).

3. **International Coordination Failures**: Regulatory arbitrage enables sophisticated actors to route activities to less regulated jurisdictions, undermining effectiveness of unilateral policies and creating systematic selection bias in compliance data.

4. **Evidence Quality Crisis**: Fewer than 20% of evaluations meet moderate evidence standards, with most assessments based on self-reporting by regulated entities, theoretical modeling, or anecdotal observations rather than rigorous empirical analysis.

5. **Counterfactual Impossibility**: The absence of control groups and inability to observe what would have happened without specific policies makes causal attribution extremely difficult, particularly for rare events like catastrophic AI failures that policies aim to prevent.

6. **Strategic Response Underestimation**: Regulated entities adapt to policies through threshold gaming, compliance theater, jurisdictional arbitrage, and other strategic responses that maintain risks while appearing to satisfy regulatory requirements, systematically biasing effectiveness assessments upward.

## International Coordination Mechanisms

Beyond existing frameworks, several emerging coordination mechanisms show promise for improving global AI governance effectiveness:

### Regime Complex Development

[Carnegie Endowment research (March 2024)](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/envisioning-a-global-regime-complex-to-govern-artificial-intelligence) suggests the world will likely see emergence of a "regime complex comprising multiple institutions" rather than a single institutional solution. This approach recognizes that different aspects of AI governance—from <EntityLink id="compute-governance">compute oversight</EntityLink> to liability frameworks—may require specialized institutional arrangements.

### International AI Agency Proposals

[Oxford Academic research (2024)](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/101/4/1483/8141294) argues for establishing an International Artificial Intelligence Agency (IAIA) under UN auspices, providing "dedicated international body to legitimately oversee global AI governance" with frameworks involving all stakeholders. The [International AI Safety Report 2026](https://internationalaisafetyreport.org/publication/international-ai-safety-report-2026) represents the "most rigorous assessment of AI capabilities, risks, and risk management available" with contributions from over 100 experts and guidance from experts nominated by over 30 countries.

### Liability and Insurance Frameworks

Emerging liability frameworks create market-based incentives for AI safety:

| Framework | Jurisdiction | Key Provisions | Status | Source |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| **EU AI Liability Directive** | European Union | Strict liability for high-risk autonomous AI; mandatory insurance coverage | Draft legislation | [European Parliament (2023)](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2023/739342/EPRS_BRI(2023)739342_EN.pdf) |
| **WEF Liability Framework** | International guidance | Balance innovation protection with victim compensation | Recommendation | [Monetizely (2024)](https://www.getmonetizely.com/articles/who-is-responsible-for-agentic-ai-understanding-legal-liability-in-autonomous-systems) |
| **Specialized AI Insurance** | Market-based | Financial protection while creating market incentives for safer development | Emerging market | Multiple sources |

The [WEF 2023 report](https://www.getmonetizely.com/articles/who-is-responsible-for-agentic-ai-understanding-legal-liability-in-autonomous-systems) emphasizes that liability frameworks must balance innovation protection with victim compensation, while specialized AI liability insurance provides "financial protection while creating market incentives for safer development."

## Effectiveness Patterns and Lessons

### High-Performing Policy Characteristics

Analysis across policy types reveals several characteristics associated with higher effectiveness rates. **Specificity in requirements** consistently outperforms vague obligations—policies with measurable, objective criteria achieve higher compliance and behavioral change than those relying on subjective standards like "responsible AI development."

**Third-party verification mechanisms** significantly enhance policy effectiveness when verification entities possess genuine independence and technical competence. **Meaningful consequences** for non-compliance, whether through market access restrictions, legal liability, or reputational damage, prove essential for sustained behavioral change.

**International coordination** emerges as crucial for policies targeting globally mobile activities like AI development. Unilateral approaches often trigger regulatory arbitrage as companies relocate activities to less regulated jurisdictions.

### Low-Performing Policy Characteristics

Conversely, certain policy design features consistently underperform. **Pure voluntary frameworks** without enforcement mechanisms rarely achieve sustained behavioral change under competitive pressure. **Vague principle-based approaches** that fail to specify concrete obligations create compliance uncertainty and enable strategic interpretation by regulated entities.

**Fragmented jurisdictional approaches** allow sophisticated actors to route around regulations, while **after-the-fact enforcement** models prove inadequate for preventing harms from already-deployed systems. **Definition disputes** over core terms like "AI" or "high-risk" create implementation delays and compliance uncertainty.

### Strategic Governance Patterns

[LessWrong analysis (2024)](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6nNwMbdRXZDuNd4Gx/analysis-of-global-ai-governance-strategies) reveals that "strategy preferences shift significantly based on key variables like timeline and alignment difficulty." Cooperative Development proves most effective with longer timelines and easier alignment challenges, while Strategic Advantage becomes more viable under shorter timelines or moderate alignment difficulty.

## Future Trajectory and Recommendations

### Two-Year Outlook (2025-2027)

Near-term policy effectiveness assessment will likely see modest improvements as initial AI governance frameworks mature and generate more robust evidence. EU AI Act implementation will provide crucial data on comprehensive regulatory approaches, while U.S. federal AI policies will face potential political transitions that may alter enforcement priorities.

Evidence infrastructure should improve significantly with increased investment in AI incident databases, compliance monitoring systems, and academic research on policy outcomes. However, the fundamental challenge of short observation periods will persist, limiting confidence in effectiveness conclusions.

### Medium-Term Projections (2027-2030)

The 2027-2030 period may provide the first robust effectiveness assessments as policies implemented in 2024-2025 generate sufficient longitudinal data. International coordination mechanisms will likely mature, enabling better evaluation of global governance approaches versus national strategies.

Technology-policy mismatches may become more apparent as rapid AI advancement outpaces regulatory frameworks designed for current capabilities. This mismatch could drive either governance framework updates or policy obsolescence, depending on institutional adaptation capacity.

### Research and Infrastructure Priorities

Effective policy evaluation requires substantial investment in evaluation infrastructure currently lacking in the AI governance field:

**Incident databases** tracking AI system failures, near-misses, and adverse outcomes need systematic development with standardized reporting mechanisms and sufficient funding for sustained operation. **Longitudinal studies** tracking policy impacts over 5-10 year periods require immediate initiation given the time scales needed for meaningful assessment.

**Cross-jurisdictional comparison studies** can leverage natural experiments as different regions implement varying approaches to similar AI governance challenges. **Compliance monitoring systems** with real-time tracking capabilities and **counterfactual analysis methods** for estimating what would have occurred without specific policies represent critical methodological investments for the field.

## Conclusions and Implications

Policy effectiveness assessment in AI governance reveals a field in its infancy, with more questions than answers about what approaches actually reduce AI risks. Current evidence suggests mandatory requirements with clear enforcement mechanisms outperform <EntityLink id="voluntary-commitments">voluntary commitments</EntityLink>, while specific, measurable obligations prove more effective than vague principles.

However, no current policy adequately addresses catastrophic risks from frontier AI development, and international coordination remains insufficient for globally mobile AI capabilities. The field urgently needs better evidence infrastructure, longer assessment time horizons, and willingness to abandon ineffective approaches regardless of political investment.

Most critically, policymakers must resist the temptation to declare victory based on weak evidence while investing substantially in the evaluation infrastructure needed for genuine effectiveness assessment. The stakes of AI governance are too high for policies based primarily on good intentions rather than demonstrated results.

## AI Transition Model Context

Policy effectiveness assessment is critical infrastructure for the <EntityLink id="ai-transition-model" />:

| Factor | Parameter | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| <EntityLink id="civilizational-competence" /> | <EntityLink id="regulatory-capacity" /> | Compute thresholds achieve 60-75% compliance; voluntary commitments show less than 30% substantive change |
| <EntityLink id="civilizational-competence" /> | <EntityLink id="institutional-quality" /> | Only 15-20% of AI policies have measurable outcome data |

Fundamental gap: less than 20% of AI governance evaluations meet moderate evidence standards, limiting our ability to identify effective interventions.
