## Overview

[AISafety.info](https://aisafety.info/) is a collaborative Q&A wiki focused on existential risk from artificial intelligence, founded by AI safety educator Rob Miles. The project combines human-written educational content with an LLM-powered chatbot, a Discord bot bridging YouTube and Discord communities, and structured programs for content creation.

The site's core thesis is that "smarter-than-human AI may come soon" and "it could lead to human extinction." Rather than simply asserting these claims, the wiki provides structured explanations, addresses common objections, and offers pathways for further engagement.

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Technology |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Q&A Wiki** | Human-written answers to AI safety questions | Web frontend (Remix/Cloudflare) |
| **Stampy Chatbot** | LLM-powered answers with citations | RAG pipeline + GPT models |
| **Discord Bot** | YouTube integration, community moderation | Python, modular architecture |
| **Alignment Research Dataset** | Curated corpus for chatbot | HuggingFace, 10K-100K documents |

## Content & Statistics

### Wiki Content

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Live Answers** | 280+ |
| **Draft Answers** | Hundreds in development |
| **Content Updates** | Ongoing community contributions |
| **Feedback System** | Google Docs integration for comments |

### Alignment Research Dataset

The chatbot draws from a curated corpus hosted on HuggingFace:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Document Count** | 10,000 - 100,000 |
| **Monthly Downloads** | ≈1,600 |
| **License** | MIT |
| **Language** | English |

## Technical Architecture

### Stampy Chatbot (RAG Pipeline)

The chatbot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a three-step process:

1. **Retrieval**: Search the alignment-research-dataset for semantically similar chunks using vector embeddings
2. **Context Assembly**: Feed relevant text snippets into an LLM's context window
3. **Generation**: Produce a summary with citations to source documents

**Dual Response Strategy**: Stampy prioritizes human-written answers from the wiki when available, falling back to AI-generated responses for novel questions. This reduces hallucination risk for common questions while maintaining coverage for the "long tail."

**Acknowledged Limitations**: The documentation explicitly warns that "like all LLM-based chatbots, it will sometimes hallucinate." Source citations allow users to verify accuracy.

### Discord Bot Architecture

The Discord bot ([StampyAI/stampy](https://github.com/StampyAI/stampy)) has evolved significantly from its original purpose:

**Module System**: Rob Miles implemented a "bidding" architecture where different modules compete to handle messages, minimizing computation by only activating relevant handlers.

**Key Modules**:
- Question management (Questions, QuestionSetter)
- Factoid database
- Wolfram Alpha integration
- LLM response generation (GPT-4 whitelist available)
- Alignment Forum search

### YouTube-Discord Bridge

A distinctive feature is bidirectional integration with Rob Miles' YouTube channel:

1. **YouTube → Discord**: Interesting comments from YouTube videos are posted to Discord, sparking community discussions
2. **Discord → YouTube**: Quality responses can be posted back as official YouTube replies

**Quality Control via Stamps**: The system uses a "stamp" emoji reaction for karma voting. When responses receive enough stamps, they can be posted to YouTube. Critically, **stamp value varies by user reputation** using a PageRank-style algorithm—users with more stamps have more voting power.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Stamp Reactions** | Karma voting for response quality |
| **PageRank Weighting** | Vote weight proportional to voter's reputation |
| **Threshold Posting** | Responses posted to YouTube when stamp threshold met |
| **Bot Identity** | Prevents random users from posting as official channel |

## Repository Ecosystem
