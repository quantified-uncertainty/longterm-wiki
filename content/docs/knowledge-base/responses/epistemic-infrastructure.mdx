## Overview

Epistemic infrastructure comprises the foundational systems, institutions, and technologies that enable societies to create reliable knowledge, verify claims, preserve information over time, and maintain shared understanding of reality. Just as physical infrastructure like roads and power grids enables economic activity, epistemic infrastructure enables collective reasoning and informed decision-making across societies.

The urgency of building robust epistemic infrastructure has intensified dramatically with the rise of digital misinformation, AI-generated content, and the fragmentation of shared epistemic authorities. Current global investment in dedicated epistemic infrastructure remains severely limited—the <R id="3968e45fa1cef763">European Media and Information Fund</R> received 25 million euros from Google over five years, while the U.S. Department of Defense awarded a <R id="0783278aaae893af">\$7.5 million grant</R> to study AI-driven misinformation—despite the potential to affect 3-5 billion internet users. This represents one of the most significant resource allocation failures in addressing information quality at scale.

The stakes are particularly high as we enter an era where AI systems can generate convincing but false information at unprecedented scale. According to <R id="0a62bd00fc79c681">NewsGuard's December 2024 AI Misinformation Monitor</R>, the 10 leading AI chatbots collectively repeated false claims 40.33% of the time. Meanwhile, research from the <R id="881fde79a514bec3">Tow Center for Digital Journalism</R> found that more than 60% of responses from AI-powered search engines were inaccurate. Without robust epistemic infrastructure, societies risk losing the ability to distinguish truth from falsehood, undermining democratic governance, scientific progress, and social cohesion. Conversely, AI technologies also offer transformative opportunities to enhance verification capabilities, potentially reducing verification costs by 90% or more while dramatically expanding the scale of fact-checking and knowledge synthesis.

## The Current Crisis in Knowledge Infrastructure

Modern information systems suffer from fundamental structural problems that make reliable knowledge creation and verification extremely difficult. The existing ecosystem is characterized by fragmented verification efforts, where each platform or outlet conducts its own fact-checking in isolation, leading to duplicated effort and inconsistent standards. There is no shared knowledge base that serves as a common reference point, resulting in different authoritative sources providing contradictory information on the same topics.

Commercial incentives further distort the information landscape, as platforms optimize for engagement rather than accuracy, creating economic pressure to promote sensational or polarizing content over reliable information. This has coincided with widespread skill atrophy in information literacy, as fewer people possess the training to critically evaluate claims or assess source credibility. Additionally, the concentration of knowledge within private platform ecosystems creates dangerous dependencies, where valuable information could be lost if commercial entities change policies or cease operations.

### The Verification Gap

| Metric | Current State | Scale of Challenge |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Claims fact-checked | Less than 1% of verifiable claims | Billions of claims daily across platforms |
| Viral misinformation addressed | Less than 5% before peak spread | Median 15-18 hours for Community Notes publication |
| Professional fact-checker capacity | Hundreds of claims per day | Insufficient for platform scale |
| Community Notes coverage | 26% of election misinformation received notes (Oct 2024) | 74% of election misinformation unaddressed per <R id="b559f3d67b063e50">CCDH</R> |
| AI chatbot accuracy | 60% false claim rate on prompts | Per <R id="0a62bd00fc79c681">NewsGuard December 2024 audit</R> |

## Core Components of Epistemic Infrastructure

### Knowledge Bases and Structured Information

The foundation of epistemic infrastructure consists of comprehensive, machine-readable knowledge repositories with clear provenance tracking. <R id="731bcab842214102">Wikipedia</R> represents the most successful example, with over 60 million articles across 300+ languages, demonstrating that volunteer-driven knowledge creation can achieve remarkable scale and quality. According to a <R id="731bcab842214102">2023 study by Sverrir Steinsson</R>, "Wikipedia transformed from a dubious source of information in its early years to an increasingly reliable one over time," becoming "an active fact-checker and anti-fringe." A 2014 pharmacology study found drug information accuracy of 99.7%, while educational psychologist Sam Wineburg stated in 2024 that "No, Wikipedia isn't an unreliable source that anyone can edit and that should be avoided."

<R id="e0975f5f1abf3a39">Wikidata</R> extends this model to structured data, containing 1.65 billion item statements (semantic triples) as of early 2025, making it the world's largest open-access knowledge graph. Data from Wikidata is viewed by more than a billion people every month and is used by Wikipedia, Apple, Google, and the Library of Congress. The most-used property, "cites work," appears on more than 290 million item pages.

<R id="5bb3d01201f0cc39">Semantic Scholar</R>, developed at the Allen Institute for AI, has revolutionized academic knowledge access, using machine learning and natural language processing to analyze over 200 million research papers and extract insights about research trends, influence, and connections that would be impossible for humans to identify manually. Its Citation Analysis feature identifies highly influential citations and the context in which papers are cited.

However, significant gaps remain in domain coverage, particularly for non-Western knowledge systems, rapidly evolving technical fields, and practical knowledge that doesn't fit academic publication models. The challenge of maintaining knowledge bases also intensifies with scale—Wikipedia requires constant vigilance from thousands of editors to maintain quality and neutrality standards. A <R id="0dbc8bce7234e9c3">2024 study</R> identified moderate but significant liberal bias in Wikipedia's source citations.

### Verification Networks and Fact-Checking Systems

Distributed fact-checking represents a promising approach to scaling verification capabilities while maintaining quality standards. The <R id="a9e552996d830d81">International Fact-Checking Network</R> has established verification principles adopted by over 100 organizations worldwide, creating common standards for evidence evaluation, transparency, and correction policies. The ClaimReview schema, developed by Schema.org and adopted by Google and other platforms, provides a standardized format for sharing fact-check results across the web.

Research on fact-checking effectiveness reveals important nuances. A <R id="0b9b5a721733767d">PNAS study</R> found that "when it comes to the effects of fact-checking on belief in misinformation, the effects are remarkably similar across countries" despite stark differences in educational, economic, and racial demographics. However, <R id="9f8baccee13e8085">timing matters significantly</R>—debunking after exposure tends to be more effective than prebunking, and effectiveness diminishes with delay. A <R id="9bcc06d40d1e3e58">Nature study</R> found that framing fact-checks as confirmations ("It is TRUE that p") rather than refutations ("It is FALSE that not p") significantly increases engagement.

<R id="6805f35f1a3a3f09">Community Notes on X/Twitter</R> has demonstrated the potential of crowd-sourced verification at scale. According to a <R id="2c7652dadc7008ed">UC San Diego study</R>, 97.5% of Community Notes were entirely accurate, with 49% citing highly credible sources like peer-reviewed studies and 44% citing moderately credible sources. Research found that tweets with Community Notes received <R id="ab1e9c70ec26c640">35.5% fewer retweets and 33.2% fewer likes</R>, while posts with public correction notes were 32% more likely to be deleted by authors. However, the median response time of over 15-18 hours means posts have typically reached 80% of their audience before notes appear.

### Reputation and Trust Mechanisms

Tracking source reliability over time requires sophisticated reputation systems that can aggregate evidence about accuracy, bias, and credibility across multiple dimensions. <R id="91908d26262f8ecb">NewsGuard</R> has developed comprehensive ratings for over 8,000 news websites on a 0-100 scale, evaluating factors like transparency, accountability, and editorial standards. As of June 2024, ratings ranged from The Washington Post at 100 to Newsmax and One America News Network at 20. Each rated publisher receives a detailed "Nutrition Label" with specific examples of content causing failures on rating criteria. NewsGuard's <R id="395316b69770382c">2024 Election Misinformation Tracking Center</R> combines journalist expertise with AI for early detection of election misinformation.

| Source Type | Example Rating (2024) | Key Characteristics |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Top-tier news | Washington Post: 100 | Full transparency, clear corrections policy |
| Quality partisan | The New Republic: 92.5 | Reliable with identifiable perspective |
| Mixed reliability | Fox News: 69.5 | Some transparency gaps, opinion/fact distinction issues |
| Low reliability | One America News: 20 | Significant accuracy and transparency problems |

Academic citation networks provide another model for reputation assessment. <R id="6391938bfe387723">Semantic Scholar's</R> influence metrics demonstrate how AI can identify particularly important papers by analyzing complex citation networks beyond simple citation counts, distinguishing highly influential citations from perfunctory references.

The challenge lies in gaming resistance. A <R id="a9e552996d830d81">Harvard Kennedy School analysis</R> notes that "fact-checking's efficacy can vary a lot depending on a host of highly contextual, poorly understood factors." Coordinated inauthentic behavior, fake peer review rings, and other adversarial tactics can distort reputation signals.

## AI Enhancement Opportunities and Risks

Artificial intelligence offers transformative potential for epistemic infrastructure, with the capability to automate time-consuming verification tasks and scale knowledge synthesis beyond human capacity. AI systems can extract structured information from documents at superhuman speed, cross-reference claims against vast databases in seconds, and identify inconsistencies that human reviewers might miss. According to <R id="f79b21f58e803075">Originality.ai research</R>, AI fact-checking tools achieve 86-87% accuracy on verification tasks, with costs of \$1.10-\$1.00 per verification compared to \$50-200 for professional human fact-checkers.

### AI Fact-Checking Performance Comparison

| Tool/Approach | Accuracy | Cost per Claim | Speed | Key Limitation |
|---------------|----------|----------------|-------|----------------|
| Professional human fact-checkers | 90-95% | \$50-200 | Hours to days | Cannot scale to platform volume |
| AI-assisted tools (Originality, GPT-5) | 85-87% | \$0.10-\$1.00 | Seconds | Should be used as aid, not final source |
| Community Notes | 97.5% accurate | Volunteer time | 15-18 hours median | Slow response, coverage gaps |
| AI-powered search engines | Less than 40% accurate | Free | Instant | <R id="881fde79a514bec3">60%+ responses contain inaccuracies</R> |

Natural language processing enables real-time claim detection across multiple platforms, automatically identifying statements that warrant verification based on patterns associated with misinformation. The <R id="a08cfcaf32c36175">Reuters Institute</R> found that generative AI is already helping fact-checkers save time, though tools prove less useful for small languages and outside Western contexts. Machine learning models trained on expert fact-checker decisions can prioritize claims most likely to be false or most important to verify, optimizing limited human verification resources.

However, AI integration introduces significant risks that could undermine epistemic infrastructure if not carefully managed. A <R id="246011d53fc7e0d5">PNAS study from December 2024</R> revealed a concerning finding: "Even LLMs that accurately identify false headlines do not necessarily enhance users' abilities to discern headline accuracy." LLM fact checks can actually reduce belief in true news wrongly labeled as false and increase belief in dubious headlines when the AI is uncertain. <R id="29d8bdce08daf5a4">Challenges in automating fact-checking</R> include the elusive nature of truth claims, the rigidity of binary true/false epistemology, data scarcity, and algorithmic deficiencies.

Most critically, as AI systems become more sophisticated, distinguishing AI-generated content from human-created information becomes increasingly difficult. The <R id="d25a731963a5a372">2024 WEF Global Risk Report</R> ranks misinformation and disinformation as the most dangerous short-term global risk, as LLMs have enabled an "explosion in falsified information." Defending against AI-generated misinformation requires AI-powered detection systems, creating an arms race dynamic with uncertain outcomes.

## Safety Implications and Societal Impact

The development of robust epistemic infrastructure has profound implications for AI safety and broader societal resilience. Reliable knowledge systems serve as crucial safeguards against AI-generated misinformation, providing authoritative references that can help humans and AI systems distinguish truth from fabrication. As AI systems become more integrated into decision-making processes, their training and fine-tuning increasingly depends on the quality of available information—making epistemic infrastructure a form of upstream safety intervention.

Concerning aspects include the potential for epistemic infrastructure itself to become a target for adversarial manipulation. If authoritative knowledge bases or verification systems become compromised, the damage could be amplified across all systems that rely on them. The concentration of epistemic authority in few centralized systems could create single points of failure or enable coordinated attacks on shared understanding.

### C2PA: Content Provenance and Authentication

The <R id="ff89bed1f7960ab2">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)</R> has emerged as a crucial standard for tracking digital content origins. Content Credentials function like a nutrition label for digital content, providing transparent information about how content was created, edited, and by whom.

**2024 adoption milestones:**
- **May 2024:** <R id="ef8f36f35933a4b5">OpenAI joined C2PA</R> as a steering committee member
- **September 2024:** Meta and Amazon joined as steering committee members
- **Technical progress:** <R id="65e0dc3fa94950bb">Google collaborated on C2PA version 2.1</R>, with stricter requirements against tampering attacks
- **January 2024:** C2PA established an official Trust List as part of specification 2.0
- **Hardware integration:** Sony cameras (Alpha 9 III, Alpha 1, Alpha 7S III) and Nikon cameras implementing Content Credentials
- **Standardization:** C2PA specification expected to be adopted as <R id="50ddf0138c02a04f">ISO international standard by 2025</R>

The <R id="f98ad3ca8d4f80d2">World Privacy Forum's technical review</R> notes both the potential and challenges of C2PA for balancing content authenticity with privacy concerns.

The global nature of information flow requires international coordination on epistemic infrastructure standards. However, different countries and cultures have varying approaches to information verification and authority, creating challenges for universal systems. The risk of epistemic infrastructure becoming a tool of soft power or cultural dominance requires careful attention to governance structures and representation.

## Current Trajectory and Future Development

In the immediate 1-2 year timeframe, we can expect continued expansion of existing systems like Wikipedia, growing adoption of content authentication standards, and increased integration of AI tools into fact-checking workflows. Major platforms are likely to implement more sophisticated misinformation detection, though coordination between platforms will remain limited. Government initiatives like the <R id="f3961fcd65f8d6f2">EU's Digital Services Act</R>, which has allocated 11 million euros to establish 8 EDMO regional hubs, will create new requirements for platform accountability.

The 2-5 year horizon presents more fundamental transformation opportunities. Cross-platform verification systems that can share fact-check results and coordinate efforts across different services may emerge, dramatically improving efficiency. AI-assisted knowledge synthesis could enable real-time updating of authoritative information as new evidence becomes available. The Wikidata Embedding Project (October 2025) provides vector-based semantic search and supports the Model Context Protocol standard, making structured knowledge more readily available to AI systems.

However, the trajectory faces significant headwinds. The <R id="d25a731963a5a372">Carnegie Endowment's evidence-based policy guide</R> recommends that "democracies should adopt a portfolio approach to manage uncertainty," pursuing diversified counter-disinformation efforts while learning and rebalancing over time. Sustainable funding models remain unclear—the public goods nature of reliable information creates classic free-rider problems.

The integration of large language models into search and information systems represents a particular inflection point. A <R id="45e2f7288f950f01">national survey</R> found that U.S. adults evaluate fact-checking labels created by professional fact-checkers as more effective than labels by algorithms or peer users, suggesting that human oversight remains valuable even as AI capabilities grow.

## Key Uncertainties and Research Priorities

Several fundamental uncertainties will determine whether robust epistemic infrastructure can be successfully built and maintained at global scale. The feasibility of sustainable funding models remains highly uncertain, with estimates ranging from 10-50% probability of finding long-term financing mechanisms that don't compromise independence or create perverse incentives.

The accuracy ceiling for AI-assisted verification is another critical unknown. Current systems achieve 85-87% accuracy on verification tasks per <R id="f79b21f58e803075">Originality.ai benchmarks</R>, approaching but not matching human expert performance (90-95%). Whether this gap can be closed without unacceptable false positive rates remains unclear. Research from <R id="dd6f2b62bdf62bd8">Frontiers in AI</R> explores both "the perils and promises of fact-checking with large language models."

Governance questions present perhaps the greatest uncertainty. The legitimacy and effectiveness of global epistemic infrastructure depends on finding governance models that balance expertise with democratic representation, maintain independence from commercial and political pressures, and adapt to changing technological and social conditions. Research on <R id="fb5b6fd67d658bee">technical infrastructure as a hidden terrain of disinformation</R> argues for shifting policy conversations around content moderation to encompass stronger cybersecurity architectures.

Research priorities funded by the <R id="180a1f7ab9ba4a6e">NSF</R> include developing models of how disinformation is seeded and spread, creating rapid-analysis frameworks, and implementing multi-stakeholder collaborations. Cross-cultural research on epistemic standards and practices, as explored in <R id="8e0a70a3261e2dc1">studies on risk perceptions across the Global North and South</R>, could inform more globally inclusive infrastructure design.
