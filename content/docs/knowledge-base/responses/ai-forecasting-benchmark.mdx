## Overview

The [AI Forecasting Benchmark Tournament](https://www.metaculus.com/aib/) represents <EntityLink id="metaculus">Metaculus</EntityLink>'s flagship initiative for comparing human and AI forecasting capabilities. Launched in 2024, the tournament runs in two parallel series:

1. **Primary Seasonal Tournament**: 4-month competitions with ~300-400 questions
2. **MiniBench**: Bi-weekly fast-paced tournaments for rapid iteration

Participants can compete using API credits provided by OpenAI and Anthropic, encouraging experimentation with frontier LLMs. The tournament has become the premier benchmark for tracking AI progress on forecasting—a domain that requires integrating diverse information sources, reasoning under uncertainty, and calibrating confidence to match reality.

### Structure

| Component | Duration | Question Count | Prize Pool |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Seasonal Tournament** | 4 months | ≈300-400 | \$10,000 |
| **MiniBench** | 2 weeks | ≈20-30 | Varies |

Both components use Metaculus's **Peer score** metric, which compares forecasters to each other and equalizes for question difficulty, making performance comparison fair across different question sets.

### Quarterly Performance Trajectory

| Quarter | Best Bot Performance | Gap to Pro Forecasters | Key Development |
|---------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Q3 2024** | -11.3 | Large negative gap | Initial baseline |
| **Q4 2024** | -8.6 | Moderate negative gap | ≈24% improvement |
| **Q1 2025** | First place (metac-o1) | Narrowing gap | First bot to lead leaderboard |
| **Q2 2025** | OpenAI o3 (baseline) | Statistical gap remains (p = 0.00001) | Humans maintain clear lead |

**Note**: Score of 0 = equal to comparison group. Negative scores mean underperformance relative to Pro Forecasters.

### Q2 2025 Detailed Results

[Q2 2025 tournament results](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/F2stjK9wHSy3HPEC9/q2-ai-benchmark-results-pros-maintain-clear-lead) provided key insights:

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Questions** | 348 |
| **Bot-makers** | 54 |
| **Statistical significance** | Pro Forecasters lead at p = 0.00001 |
| **Top bot-makers** | Top 3 (excluding Metaculus in-house) were students or hobbyists |
| **Aggregation effect** | Taking median or mean of multiple forecasts improved scores significantly |
| **Best baseline bot** | OpenAI's o3 |

## Key Findings

### Pro Forecasters Maintain Lead

Despite rapid AI improvement, human expert forecasters remain statistically significantly better:

| Evidence | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| **p = 0.00001** | Extremely strong statistical significance |
| **Consistent across quarters** | Not a fluke; reproducible result |
| **Even best bots trail** | Top AI systems still below human expert level |

### Students and Hobbyists Competitive

The top 3 bot-makers (excluding Metaculus's in-house bots) in Q2 2025 were students or hobbyists, not professional AI researchers:

| Implication | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Low barrier to entry** | API access + creativity > credentials |
| **Forecasting as craft** | Domain knowledge + prompt engineering matters more than ML expertise |
| **Innovation from edges** | Some of the best approaches come from non-traditional participants |

### Aggregation Helps Significantly

Taking the median or mean of multiple LLM forecasts rather than single calls substantially improved scores:

| Method | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| **Single LLM call** | Baseline |
| **Median of multiple calls** | Significantly better |
| **Mean of multiple calls** | Significantly better |

This suggests that **ensemble methods** are critical for AI forecasting, similar to how aggregating multiple human forecasters improves accuracy.

### Metaculus Community Prediction Remains Strong

The average Peer score for the Metaculus Community Prediction is **12.9**, ranking in the **top 10 on the global leaderboard** over every 2-year period since 2016. This demonstrates that aggregated human forecasts remain world-class and provide a high bar for AI systems to match.

## Technical Implementation

### Bot Development Process

Participants develop forecasting bots using:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **API Access** | OpenAI and Anthropic provide credits |
| **Metaculus API** | Fetch questions, submit forecasts |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Craft prompts that produce well-calibrated forecasts |
| **Aggregation Logic** | Combine multiple model calls or different models |
| **Continuous Learning** | Iterate based on quarterly feedback |

### Scoring: Peer Score

Metaculus uses **Peer score** for fair comparison:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Relative comparison** | Compares forecasters to each other, not absolute truth |
| **Difficulty adjustment** | Accounts for question hardness |
| **Time-averaged** | Rewards updating when new information emerges |
| **Equalizes participation** | Forecasters with different time constraints comparable |

### Baseline Bots

Metaculus provides baseline bots for comparison:

| Bot | Method | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **GPT-4o** | Vanilla frontier LLM | Standard baseline |
| **o3** | OpenAI's reasoning model | Best performance (Q2 2025) |
| **Claude variants** | Anthropic frontier models | Alternative baseline |
| **Metaculus in-house** | Custom implementations | Metaculus's own research |

## Comparison with Other Projects

| Project | Organization | Focus | Structure | Scale |
|---------|--------------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **AI Forecasting Benchmark** | Metaculus | Human vs AI | Quarterly tournaments | ≈350 questions/quarter |
| **<EntityLink id="forecastbench">ForecastBench</EntityLink>** | FRI | AI benchmarking | Continuous evaluation | 1,000 questions |
| **<EntityLink id="xpt">XPT</EntityLink>** | FRI | Expert collaboration | One-time tournament | ≈100 questions |
| **<EntityLink id="good-judgment">Good Judgment</EntityLink>** | Good Judgment Inc | Superforecaster panels | Ongoing operations | Client-specific |

The AI Forecasting Benchmark's **quarterly structure** balances rapid iteration (faster than XPT) with sufficient time for meaningful comparison (longer than weekly competitions).
