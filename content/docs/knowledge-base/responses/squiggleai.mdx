llmSummary: SquiggleAI is an LLM tool (primarily Claude Sonnet 4.5) that generates probabilistic Squiggle models from natural language, using ~20K tokens of cached documentation to produce 100-500 line models in 20 seconds to 3 minutes. While it lowers barriers for domain experts to create uncertainty models, it's a workflow improvement tool rather than a core AI safety intervention.

## Overview

[SquiggleAI](https://www.squiggle-language.com/docs/Ecosystem/SquiggleAI) integrates <EntityLink id="language-models">large language models</EntityLink> to assist with probabilistic model creation, addressing a critical barrier QURI identified through years of experience building forecasting tools: **even highly skilled domain experts frequently struggle with basic programming requirements** for probabilistic modeling.

A subject matter expert might have deep knowledge about AI timelines, pandemic risk, or cost-effectiveness of interventions, but lack the programming fluency to translate their mental model into executable <EntityLink id="squiggle">Squiggle</EntityLink> code. SquiggleAI bridges this gap by accepting natural language descriptions and generating complete, runnable probabilistic models.

The system uses prompt caching to embed approximately 20,000 tokens of information about the Squiggle language—syntax, distributions, best practices—ensuring the LLM has deep knowledge of the domain-specific language. Most workflows complete within 20 seconds to 3 minutes, producing models typically 100-500 lines long depending on the model used.

### Design Philosophy

SquiggleAI is designed around the principle that **domain expertise should not be bottlenecked by programming ability**. The tool aims to:

1. **Lower the barrier** to quantitative reasoning for non-programmers
2. **Accelerate model creation** even for experienced Squiggle users
3. **Teach by example** through generated code that users can read and modify
4. **Preserve human judgment** by making models transparent and editable

This philosophy aligns with QURI's broader mission of making uncertainty quantification accessible to altruistic decision-makers.

## Model Support

SquiggleAI supports multiple LLM backends:

| Model | Status | Output Size | Speed | Best For | Cost |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------|----------|------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Primary | ≈500 lines | Medium | Complex multi-variable models | $$$ |
| **Claude Haiku 4.5** | Available | ≈150 lines | Fast | Quick prototypes | $ |
| **Grok Code Fast 1** | Available | ≈200 lines | Fast | Alternative provider | $$ |
| **Claude Sonnet 3.5** | Legacy | ≈200 lines | Medium | Stable fallback | $$ |

The default is Claude Sonnet 4.5, which produces the most sophisticated and detailed models but at higher API cost. Users can switch models based on their needs.

### Prompt Caching

SquiggleAI uses **prompt caching** to cache approximately 20,000 tokens of Squiggle documentation with each request. This means:

- The LLM has consistent, deep knowledge of Squiggle syntax
- API costs are reduced (cached tokens are cheaper)
- Response quality is more reliable
- Context is preserved across conversation turns

## Capabilities

### Model Generation

Describe a problem in natural language, receive executable Squiggle code:

**Example prompt**:
> "Estimate the cost-effectiveness of hiring an AI safety researcher. Consider their salary, overhead costs, probability they produce useful research, and value of that research if successful."

**Output**: ~300 line Squiggle model with:
- Variable definitions for each uncertain input
- Distribution choices justified by context
- Sensitivity analysis visualization
- Clear comments explaining logic

### Iterative Refinement

Conversation-based model improvement:

**Follow-up prompt**:
> "Add more uncertainty to the timeline assumptions and break down the research impact by type (interpretability vs alignment)."

**Output**: Modified model with requested changes, preserving existing structure.

### Fermi Estimation

Generate complete uncertainty models from vague questions:

| Question Type | Example | Output |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| **Classic Fermi** | "How many piano tuners in Chicago?" | ≈100 line model with breakdown |
| **Technology adoption** | "When will 50% of US households have solar panels?" | ≈200 line S-curve model |
| **Market sizing** | "Total addressable market for AI coding assistants?" | ≈250 line market model |

### Code Debugging

Identify and fix syntax and logic errors:

**User**: "My model gives negative probabilities for the success rate"

**SquiggleAI**: Identifies issue with distribution domain, suggests `truncate(distribution, 0, 1)`

### Model Explanation

Explain what existing Squiggle code does:

**Input**: Inherited 300-line model from another researcher

**Prompt**: "Explain what this model is calculating and what the key assumptions are"

**Output**: Plain-language summary with identified cruxes

## Integration with Squiggle Hub

SquiggleAI is **directly accessible from within Squiggle Hub**, allowing users to:

1. Generate models from the "New Model" interface
2. Refine existing models through chat interface
3. Immediately save generated models to their Hub account
4. Version control AI-assisted iterations
5. Share completed models publicly or keep private

### Privacy Defaults

SquiggleAI outputs on Squiggle Hub are **private by default**. Users who want to share models or make them public can explicitly do so by creating new public models. This privacy-first approach encourages experimentation without concern about incomplete drafts being visible.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
User Prompt
    ↓
Prompt Engineering Layer
(Adds cached Squiggle docs, examples, constraints)
    ↓
LLM API (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
    ↓
Post-Processing
(Syntax validation, auto-fixes)
    ↓
Executable Squiggle Code
```

### Prompt Engineering

The system prepends each user request with:

| Component | Tokens | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Squiggle syntax guide** | ≈8,000 | Core language reference |
| **Distribution creation examples** | ≈3,000 | Common patterns |
| **Best practices** | ≈2,000 | Dos and don'ts |
| **Common pitfalls** | ≈1,500 | Error prevention |
| **Example models** | ≈5,500 | Full model templates |
| **Total cached context** | ≈20,000 | Consistent knowledge base |

This large cached context ensures the LLM produces idiomatic Squiggle code rather than generic probabilistic programming.
