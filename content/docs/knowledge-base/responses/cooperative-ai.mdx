## Overview

Cooperative AI is a research agenda focused on developing AI systems that can cooperate effectively with humans, with each other, and within complex multi-agent environments. The field addresses a crucial observation: as AI systems become more capable and more numerous, the dynamics between AI agents become increasingly important for global outcomes. Adversarial or competitive AI dynamics could lead to arms races, coordination failures, and collectively suboptimal outcomes even if each individual system is pursuing seemingly reasonable goals.

The research draws on game theory, multi-agent reinforcement learning, mechanism design, and social science to understand when and how cooperation emerges (or fails to emerge) among intelligent agents. Key questions include: How can AI systems be designed to cooperate even when competitive pressures exist? What mechanisms enable stable cooperation? How do we prevent races to the bottom where AI systems undercut safety standards to gain competitive advantage?

Led primarily by <EntityLink id="deepmind">DeepMind</EntityLink> and academic groups including UC Berkeley's CHAI, cooperative AI research has grown in prominence as multi-agent AI deployments become common. The foundational paper ["Open Problems in Cooperative AI"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08630) (Dafoe et al., 2020) established the research agenda and led to the creation of the [Cooperative AI Foundation](https://www.cooperativeai.com/foundation) with \$15 million in funding. The field addresses both near-term concerns (multiple AI assistants interacting, AI-AI negotiation) and long-term concerns (preventing catastrophic multi-agent dynamics, ensuring AI systems don't defect on cooperative arrangements with humanity). However, the work remains largely theoretical with limited production deployment, and fundamental challenges remain in defining what "cooperation" means in high-stakes scenarios.

Cooperative AI research addresses the challenge of ensuring AI systems work together beneficially rather than engaging in destructive competition. The approach combines:

1. **Sequential Social Dilemmas**: DeepMind's framework for modeling cooperation in realistic environments where agents must learn complex behaviors, not just make binary cooperate/defect choices. Their [research on agent cooperation](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/understanding-agent-cooperation/) uses deep multi-agent reinforcement learning to understand when cooperation emerges.

2. **Assistance Games (CIRL)**: Developed by [Hadfield-Menell et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137), this formalism treats human-AI interaction as a cooperative game where both agents are rewarded according to human preferences, but the AI must learn what those preferences are through observation and interaction.

3. **Evaluation and Benchmarking**: DeepMind's [Melting Pot](https://deepmind.google/blog/melting-pot-an-evaluation-suite-for-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/) provides over 50 multi-agent scenarios testing cooperation, competition, trust, and coordination, enabling systematic evaluation of cooperative capabilities.
