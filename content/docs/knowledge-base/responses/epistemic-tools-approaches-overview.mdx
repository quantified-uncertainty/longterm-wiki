Approaches and methodologies for building epistemic infrastructure:

**Forecasting Approaches:**
- **<EntityLink id="E228">Prediction Markets</EntityLink>**: Market-based aggregation of probabilistic beliefs
- **<EntityLink id="E9">AI-Augmented Forecasting</EntityLink>**: Using AI to enhance prediction capabilities
- **<EntityLink id="E161">AI-Human Hybrid Systems</EntityLink>**: Combining human judgment with AI capabilities

**Deliberation & Coordination:**
- **<EntityLink id="E100">AI-Assisted Deliberation</EntityLink>**: Technology-mediated group reasoning
- **<EntityLink id="E77">Coordination Technologies</EntityLink>**: Tools for collective action and decision-making

**Verification & Authentication:**
- **<EntityLink id="E74">Content Authentication</EntityLink>**: Provenance and authenticity verification
- **<EntityLink id="E591">Deepfake Detection</EntityLink>**: AI-generated content identification

**[Design Sketches for Collective Epistemics](/knowledge-base/responses/collective-epistemics-design-sketches/)** (Forethought Foundation, 2025):
- **[Community Notes for Everything](/knowledge-base/responses/community-notes-for-everything/)**: Cross-platform AI-generated context annotations on misleading content
- **[Rhetoric Highlighting](/knowledge-base/responses/rhetoric-highlighting/)**: Automated detection of persuasive-but-misleading language and citation misrepresentation
- **[Reliability Tracking](/knowledge-base/responses/reliability-tracking/)**: Topic-specific track records for public actors' claims, predictions, and promises
- **[Epistemic Virtue Evals](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-virtue-evals/)**: Benchmarks testing AI systems for calibration, sycophancy resistance, and honesty
- **[Provenance Tracing](/knowledge-base/responses/provenance-tracing/)**: Infrastructure for transparent knowledge genealogy and claim reliability assessment
