## Overview

The AI safety field faces a critical talent bottleneck. While funding has increased substantially—with <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> committing roughly \$50 million to <EntityLink id="technical-research">technical AI safety research</EntityLink> in 2024—the supply of researchers capable of doing high-quality technical safety work remains constrained. Training programs represent the primary pipeline for addressing this gap, offering structured pathways from general ML expertise to safety-specific research skills.

The landscape has evolved rapidly since 2020. [MATS (ML Alignment Theory Scholars)](https://www.matsprogram.org/) has become the premier research mentorship program, with [78% of surveyed alumni now working in AI alignment](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jeBkx6agMuBCQW94C/mats-alumni-impact-analysis). Anthropic launched a [Fellows Program](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2024/anthropic-fellows-program/) specifically for mid-career transitions. [BlueDot Impact has trained over 7,000 people since 2022](https://bluedot.org/), with hundreds now working at organizations like Anthropic, <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>, and the <EntityLink id="uk-aisi">UK AI Safety Institute</EntityLink>. Academic programs are emerging at York (SAINTS CDT), Berkeley (<EntityLink id="chai">CHAI</EntityLink>), and Cambridge (CHIA). Independent research programs like SPAR and LASR Labs provide part-time pathways. Together, these programs produce perhaps 100-200 new safety researchers annually—a number that may be insufficient given the pace of AI capabilities advancement.

The strategic importance of training extends beyond individual researcher production. Programs shape research culture, determine which problems receive attention, and create networks that influence the field's direction. How training programs select participants, what methodologies they emphasize, and which mentors they feature all have downstream effects on AI safety's trajectory.

## AI Transition Model Context

AI safety training programs improve the <EntityLink id="ai-transition-model" /> through multiple factors:

| Factor | Parameter | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="safety-capability-gap" /> | Produces 100-200 new safety researchers annually to address research talent bottleneck |
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="alignment-robustness" /> | Mentored researchers produce higher-quality alignment work |
| <EntityLink id="civilizational-competence" /> | <EntityLink id="institutional-quality" /> | Trained researchers staff AI Safety Institutes and governance organizations |

Training programs are critical infrastructure for the field; their effectiveness is bottlenecked by limited mentor bandwidth and retention challenges.
