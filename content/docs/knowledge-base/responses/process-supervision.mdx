## Overview

Process supervision is a training technique that rewards AI models for producing correct intermediate reasoning steps, not just correct final answers. While traditional outcome-based training only provides a training signal based on whether the final answer is right or wrong, process supervision evaluates each step in a chain-of-thought reasoning sequence. This approach emerged from research at <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink> and others investigating how to improve mathematical reasoning and code generation.

The key insight is that process supervision makes reasoning transparent and auditable. When a model is trained to show its work and each step is verified, it becomes much harder to arrive at a correct answer through flawed reasoning or to hide problematic logic within a chain of thought. This has clear safety benefits: if we can see and verify each reasoning step, we can catch errors, biases, or potentially deceptive reasoning before it leads to harmful outputs.

However, process supervision shares a fundamental limitation with <EntityLink id="rlhf">RLHF</EntityLink>: it requires humans to evaluate reasoning steps. For complex or superhuman reasoning, humans may not be able to verify whether intermediate steps are valid. Additionally, sufficiently sophisticated models might learn to produce reasoning that appears valid while actually being subtly flawed, or maintain separate internal reasoning that differs from the visible chain of thought.

The core innovation is training a **Process Reward Model (PRM)** that evaluates each intermediate step rather than just the final answer. OpenAI's foundational [Let's Verify Step by Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20050) paper released [PRM800K](https://github.com/openai/prm800k), a dataset of 800,000 step-level correctness labels for mathematical reasoning.

| Risk | Relevance | How Process Supervision Helps |
|------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| <EntityLink id="reward-hacking">Reward Hacking</EntityLink> | High | Harder to game step-by-step verification than end-to-end outcomes |
| <EntityLink id="deceptive-alignment">Deceptive Alignment</EntityLink> | Medium | Makes reasoning chains visible and auditable; catches hidden flawed logic |
| <EntityLink id="scheming">Scheming</EntityLink> | Medium | Visible reasoning makes certain deception strategies more detectable |
| <EntityLink id="sycophancy">Sycophancy</EntityLink> | Low | Step verification can catch reasoning that reaches user-desired but incorrect conclusions |

## Risk Assessment & Impact

| Risk Category | Assessment | Key Metrics | Evidence Source |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Safety Uplift** | Medium | More transparent reasoning; harder to hide bad logic | [Let's Verify Step by Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20050) |
| **Capability Uplift** | Significant | Improves math/reasoning accuracy substantially | Benchmark improvements |
| **Net World Safety** | Helpful | Probably net positive: makes reasoning auditable | Structural analysis |
| **Lab Incentive** | Strong | Improves benchmark performance; commercial benefit | Industry adoption |

### Outcome vs. Process Supervision

| Aspect | Outcome Supervision | Process Supervision |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Signal** | Only final answer | Each reasoning step |
| **Feedback granularity** | Binary (right/wrong) | Step-by-step ratings |
| **Transparency** | Reasoning hidden | Reasoning visible |
| **Error localization** | Unknown where it failed | Precise error identification |

### Training Pipeline

| Stage | Process | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **1. Data Collection** | Annotators rate each reasoning step | Create step-level supervision signal |
| **2. Process Reward Model (PRM)** | Train model to predict step correctness | Scale step evaluation |
| **3. RL Training** | Optimize policy against PRM | Reward good reasoning processes |
| **4. Verification** | Use PRM to verify/select solutions | Runtime quality assurance |

### Process Reward Models (PRMs)

A key innovation is training separate models to evaluate reasoning steps:

| Component | Function | Benefit |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Step Classifier** | Predict if step is valid | Scalable annotation |
| **Error Localizer** | Identify where reasoning fails | Debugging capability |
| **Solution Ranker** | Compare multiple solution paths | Best-of-N selection |

### Why It Helps

Process supervision improves performance by:

1. **Eliminating lucky guesses**: Can't stumble to correct answer through flawed reasoning
2. **Composable verification**: Verify complex reasoning by verifying each step
3. **Better credit assignment**: Model learns which specific steps help
4. **Reduced reward hacking**: Harder to game step-by-step than end-to-end

### Advantages

|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Transparency** | Reasoning steps are visible | Can audit for problems |
| **Error Detection** | Find where reasoning fails | Catch mistakes early |
| **Harder to Game** | Must have valid reasoning, not just valid answer | Reduces output gaming |
| **Composable** | Verify complex reasoning step-by-step | Scales verification |

### Limitations

| Limitation | Description | Severity |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Annotation Cost** | Expensive to label each step | High |
| **Human Evaluation Limit** | Humans must understand steps | Critical for superhuman |
| **Fake Reasoning Risk** | Model could show valid steps while using different internal process | Medium |
| **Domain Specificity** | Works best for formal domains (math, code) | Medium |

## Scalability Analysis

### Current Scalability

Process supervision scales reasonably well for current AI systems:

| **High School Math** | Reliable | Effective |
| **Graduate Math** | Expert annotators needed | More difficult |
| **Research-Level** | Few humans can evaluate | Questionable |
