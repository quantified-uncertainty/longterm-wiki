## Overview

Public education on AI risks represents a critical bridge between <EntityLink id="E297">technical AI safety research</EntityLink> and effective governance. This encompasses systematic efforts to communicate AI safety concepts, risks, and policy needs to diverse audiences including the general public, policymakers, journalists, and educators.

Research shows severe knowledge gaps in AI understanding among key stakeholders. A [Pew Research 2025 study](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/) found that experts and public diverge dramatically: 56% of AI experts expect positive societal impact over 20 years versus only 17% of the general public, while 47% of experts feel excited about AI versus just 11% of Americans. A <R id="f31bdc8748db7c04">2024 Pew Research study</R> found that 67% of Americans have limited understanding of AI capabilities, while <R id="9e6f976f3c55f13a">Policy Horizons Canada</R> reported that 73% of policymakers lack technical knowledge for informed <EntityLink id="E608">AI governance</EntityLink>. Effective public education initiatives have demonstrated measurable impact, with <R id="bb7c8419f3ae07ac">MIT's public engagement programs</R> increasing accurate AI risk perception by 34% among participants.

The urgency of public education has intensified as AI adoption accelerates. According to [Stanford HAI's 2025 AI Index](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report), U.S. federal agencies introduced 59 AI-related regulations in 2024—more than double the 2023 count—yet [62% of Americans believe the government is not doing enough to regulate AI](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/views-of-risks-opportunities-and-regulation-of-ai/). This regulatory activity occurs amid declining public confidence: the share of Americans viewing AI's societal effects as negative rose from 34% in December 2024 to 47% by June 2025 ([YouGov 2025](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52615-americans-increasingly-likely-say-ai-artificial-intelligence-negatively-affect-society-poll)).

- **2024:** FLI AI Safety Index launched to give public "a clear picture of where AI labs stand on safety issues"

## Key Uncertainties & Cruxes

### Communication Effectiveness Debates

**Accessible vs. Technical Communication**: Tension between making risks understandable versus maintaining technical accuracy.

- **Simplification advocates**: Argue broad awareness requires accessible messaging—current data shows only 12-23% risk comprehension
- **Technical accuracy advocates**: Warn that oversimplification distorts important nuances; AI chatbots already misrepresent news 45% of time
- **Evidence**: <R id="e1204afca1a3736d">Annenberg Public Policy Center</R> research suggests balanced approaches work best
- **Emerging evidence**: [Research](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-misinformation-and-value-trusted-news) suggests exposure to AI misinformation can actually increase value attached to credible outlets

### Timing and Urgency

**Current Education vs. Future Preparation**: Whether to focus on immediate governance needs or long-term literacy.

- **Immediate focus**: Prioritize policymaker education for near-term governance decisions—only 15% of organizations have AI policies ([ISACA 2024](https://www.isaca.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2024/the-ai-reality-new-research-from-isaca-identifies-gaps-in-ai-knowledge-training-and-policies))
- **Long-term focus**: Build general AI literacy for future democratic engagement—28 states now have K-12 AI guidance
- **Resource allocation**: Limited funding forces difficult prioritization choices; estimated \$30-60M global AI safety research annually

### Target Audience Prioritization

| Audience | Current Investment | Potential Impact | Engagement Difficulty | Priority Ranking | Key Gap |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|---------|
| **Policymakers** | High | Very High | Medium | 1 | 73% lack technical knowledge |
| **Journalists** | Medium | High | Low | 2 | 42% AI coverage lacks expert sources |
| **Educators** | Growing | Very High | High | 3 | Only 29% trained on AI integration |
| **General Public** | Medium | Medium | Very High | 4 | 67% limited understanding |
| **Industry Leaders** | High | High | Low | 2 | 40% offer no AI training |
| **Youth** | Growing | High | Medium | 3 | 70% teens used GenAI; 12% received guidance |
