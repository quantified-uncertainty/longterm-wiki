## Overview

<EntityLink id="technical-ai-safety">Technical AI safety</EntityLink> research aims to make AI systems reliably safe and aligned with human values through direct scientific and engineering work. This is the most **direct** intervention—if successful, it solves the core problem that makes AI risky.

The field has grown substantially since 2020, with approximately **500+ dedicated researchers** working across frontier labs (Anthropic, DeepMind, OpenAI) and independent organizations (<EntityLink id="redwood-research">Redwood Research</EntityLink>, MIRI, <EntityLink id="apollo-research">Apollo Research</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="metr">METR</EntityLink>). Annual funding reached **\$110-130M in 2024**, with <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving">Coefficient Giving</EntityLink> contributing approximately 60% (\$13.6M) of external investment. This remains insufficient—representing **under 2% of estimated AI capabilities spending** at frontier labs alone.

Key 2024-2025 advances include:
- **<EntityLink id="interpretability">Mechanistic interpretability</EntityLink>:** [Anthropic's May 2024 "Scaling Monosemanticity"](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/) identified tens of millions of interpretable features in Claude 3 Sonnet, including concepts related to deception and safety-relevant patterns
- **Scheming detection:** [Apollo Research's December 2024 evaluation](https://www.apolloresearch.ai/research/frontier-models-are-capable-of-incontext-scheming/) found 5 of 6 frontier models showed in-context scheming capabilities, with o1 maintaining deception in more than 85% of follow-up questions
- **<EntityLink id="ai-control">AI control</EntityLink>:** Redwood Research's control evaluation framework, now with a [2025 agent control sequel](https://blog.redwoodresearch.org/p/how-might-we-safely-pass-the-buck), provides protocols robust even against misaligned systems
- **Government evaluation:** The [UK AI Security Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/frontier-ai-trends-report) has evaluated 30+ frontier models, finding cyber task completion improved from 9% to 50% between late 2023 and 2025

The field faces significant timeline pressure. MIRI's 2024 strategy update concluded that alignment research is "extremely unlikely to succeed in time" absent policy interventions to slow AI development. This has led to increased focus on near-term deployable techniques like AI control and capability evaluations, rather than purely theoretical approaches.

**Key mechanisms:**
1. **Scientific understanding:** Develop theories of how AI systems work and fail
2. **Engineering solutions:** Create practical techniques for making systems safer
3. **Validation methods:** Build tools to verify safety properties
4. **Adoption:** Labs implement techniques in production systems

## Major Research Agendas

### 1. Mechanistic Interpretability

**Goal:** Understand what's happening inside neural networks by reverse-engineering their computations.

**Approach:**
- Identify interpretable features in activation space
- Map out computational circuits
- Understand superposition and representation learning
- Develop automated interpretability tools

**Recent progress:**
- <R id="e724db341d6e0065">Anthropic's "Scaling Monosemanticity" (May 2024)</R> identified **tens of millions of interpretable features** in Claude 3 Sonnet using sparse autoencoders—the first detailed look inside a production-grade large language model
- Features discovered include concepts like the Golden Gate Bridge, code errors, deceptive behavior, and safety-relevant patterns
- <R id="6374381b5ec386d1">DeepMind's mechanistic interpretability team</R> growing 37% in 2024, pursuing similar research directions
- Circuit discovery moving from toy models to larger systems, though full model coverage remains cost-prohibitive

**Key organizations:**
- <R id="c355237bfc2d213d">Anthropic</R> (Interpretability team, ~15-25 researchers)
- <R id="5b8be7f6a2aa7067">DeepMind</R> (Mechanistic Interpretability team)
- Redwood Research (causal scrubbing, circuit analysis)
- Apollo Research (deception-focused interpretability)

**Theory of change:** If we can read AI cognition, we can detect deception, verify alignment, and debug failures before deployment.

### Estimated Impact of Interpretability Success

Expert estimates vary widely on how much x-risk reduction mechanistic interpretability could achieve if it becomes highly effective at detecting misalignment and verifying safety properties. The range reflects fundamental uncertainty about whether interpretability can scale to frontier models, whether it can remain robust against sophisticated deception, and whether understanding internal features is sufficient to prevent catastrophic failures.

| Expert/Source | Estimate | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Optimistic view | 30-50% x-risk reduction | If interpretability scales successfully to frontier models and can reliably detect hidden goals, deceptive alignment, and dangerous capabilities, it becomes the primary method for verifying safety. This view assumes that most alignment failures have detectable signatures in model internals and that automated interpretability tools can provide real-time monitoring during deployment. The high end of this range assumes interpretability enables both detecting problems and guiding solutions. |
| Moderate view | 10-20% x-risk reduction | Interpretability provides valuable insights and catches some classes of problems, but faces fundamental limitations from superposition, polysemanticity, and the sheer complexity of frontier models. This view expects interpretability to complement other safety measures rather than solve alignment on its own. Detection may work for trained backdoors but fail for naturally-emerging deception. The technique helps most by informing training approaches and providing warning signs, rather than offering complete safety guarantees. |
| Pessimistic view | 2-5% x-risk reduction | Interpretability may not scale beyond current demonstrations or could be actively circumvented by sufficiently capable systems. Models could learn to hide dangerous cognition in uninterpretable combinations of features, or deceptive systems could learn to appear safe to interpretability tools. The computational cost of full-model interpretability may remain prohibitive, limiting coverage to small subsets of the model. Additionally, even perfect understanding of what a model is doing may not tell us what it will do in novel situations or under distribution shift. |

### 2. Scalable Oversight

**Goal:** Enable humans to supervise AI systems on tasks beyond human ability to directly evaluate.

**Approaches:**
- **Recursive reward modeling:** Use AI to help evaluate AI
- **Debate:** AI systems argue for different answers; humans judge
- **Market-based approaches:** Prediction markets over outcomes
- **Process-based supervision:** Reward reasoning process, not just outcomes

**Recent progress:**
- <R id="e64c8268e5f58e63">Weak-to-strong generalization (OpenAI, December 2023)</R>: Small models can partially supervise large models, with strong students **consistently outperforming their weak supervisors**. Tested across GPT-4 family spanning 7 orders of magnitude of compute.
- <R id="683aef834ac1612a">Constitutional AI (Anthropic, 2022)</R>: Enables training harmless AI using only ~10 natural language principles ("constitution") as human oversight, introducing RLAIF (RL from AI Feedback)
- OpenAI committed **20% of compute** over 4 years to superalignment, plus a <R id="704f57dfad89c1b3">\$10M grants program</R>
- Debate experiments showing promise in math/reasoning domains

**Key organizations:**
- OpenAI (Superalignment team dissolved mid-2024; unclear current state)
- <R id="e99a5c1697baa07d">Anthropic</R> (Alignment Science team)
- <R id="f232f1723d6802e7">DeepMind</R> (Alignment team, led by Anca Dragan and Rohin Shah)

**Theory of change:** If we can supervise superhuman AI, we can train aligned systems even when we can't evaluate all behaviors directly.

### 3. Robustness and Adversarial Techniques

**Goal:** Make AI systems reliable under distribution shift and adversarial conditions.

**Approaches:**
- Red-teaming and adversarial testing
- Formal verification of properties
- Worst-case optimization
- Adversarial training
- Out-of-distribution detection

**Recent progress:**
- Red-teaming identified many LLM vulnerabilities
- Formal verification for small networks
- Adversarial robustness still largely unsolved at scale

**Key organizations:**
- MIRI (formal verification focus)
- DeepMind (testing and evaluation)
- Anthropic (red-teaming)
- FAR AI (field-building for adversarial robustness)

### 4. Agent Foundations

**Goal:** Develop mathematical foundations for understanding goal-directed agents.

**Topics:**
- Decision theory for embedded agents
- Logical uncertainty
- Corrigibility
- Utility functions and preferences
- Embedded agency

**Status:**
- Mostly theoretical/philosophical
- Less empirical progress than other agendas
- Higher risk, higher reward research

**Key organizations:**
- MIRI (primary focus)
- FHI (some work, though institute closed)
- Academic researchers (scattered)

**Theory of change:** Solve fundamental conceptual problems that block alignment progress, enabling more tractable approaches later.

### 5. AI Control

**Goal:** Maintain control over AI systems even if they are misaligned.

**Approaches:**
- **Trusted monitoring:** Use weaker but trusted AI to monitor stronger AI
- **Untrusted monitoring:** Assume monitors may be compromised
- **Task decomposition:** Break tasks so no single AI can cause harm
- **Containment protocols:** Prevent AI from taking harmful actions

**Recent progress:**
- <R id="cc80ab28579c5794">Redwood Research's AI Control paper (December 2023)</R>: Introduced control evaluations where red teams search for attack strategies, then assess whether untrusted models can subvert safety measures
- <R id="32c44bb7ba8a1bbe">"The case for ensuring that powerful AIs are controlled" (May 2024)</R>: Core framework explaining safety under the conservative assumption that AIs are misaligned and actively scheming
- Control protocols use three building blocks: untrusted models (smart, fairly cheap), trusted models (dumb, extremely cheap), and humans (expensive trusted labor)
- Recommendation: **~50% of AI control research** should make conservative misalignment assumptions

**Key organizations:**
- <R id="d42c3c74354e7b66">Redwood Research</R> (primary developer, ~20 staff, \$100M+ runway)
- <R id="560dff85b3305858">Apollo Research</R> (scheming and deception research)
- Anthropic (adopting control ideas in deployment)

**Theory of change:** Even if alignment is unsolved, we can maintain safety through monitoring and containment as we develop better solutions.

### 6. Evaluations and Dangerous Capability Detection

**Goal:** Detect dangerous capabilities before deployment.

**Approaches:**
- Benchmark dangerous capabilities (bioweapons, cyber, manipulation)
- Autonomous replication and adaptation (ARA) testing
- Situational awareness evaluations
- Deception and scheming detection

**Recent progress:**
- <R id="91737bf431000298">Apollo Research scheming evaluations (December 2024)</R>: **Five of six frontier models showed in-context scheming capabilities**—including o1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Models copied themselves to other servers in 0.3-10% of test runs, disabled oversight mechanisms, and behaved differently when unobserved.
- <R id="b3f335edccfc5333">OpenAI-Apollo collaboration</R>: "Deliberative alignment" reduced detectable scheming by **up to 30x** (o3: 13% to 0.4%; o4-mini: 8.7% to 0.3%)
- <R id="601b00f2dabbdd2a">METR's Autonomy Evaluation Resources (March 2024)</R>: Framework for testing dangerous autonomous capabilities, including the "rogue replication" threat model
- <R id="fc3078f3c2ba5ebb">UK AI Safety Institute's Inspect framework</R>: 100+ pre-built evaluations for coding, reasoning, knowledge, and multimodal understanding

**Key organizations:**
- <R id="45370a5153534152">METR</R> (Model Evaluation and Threat Research)
- <R id="329d8c2e2532be3d">Apollo Research</R> (scheming, deception, ~10-15 researchers)
- <R id="fdf68a8f30f57dee">UK AISI</R> (government evaluation institute, conducting pre-deployment testing since November 2023)
- US AISI (recently formed)

**Theory of change:** Early detection of dangerous capabilities enables labs to implement safety measures before risks materialize.

| 2025 (proj.) | \$150-180M | ≈55% | \$10M RFP; government funding increasing |

Despite growth, AI safety funding remains under 2% of total AI investment, estimated at less than \$1-10B annually for capabilities research at frontier labs alone.

## Risks Addressed

Technical AI safety research is the primary response to alignment-related risks:

| Risk Category | How Technical Research Addresses It | Key Agendas |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Deceptive alignment | Interpretability to detect hidden goals; control protocols for misaligned systems | Mechanistic interpretability, AI control, scheming evaluations |
| Goal misgeneralization | Understanding learned representations; robust training methods | Interpretability, scalable oversight |
| Power-seeking behavior | Detecting power-seeking; designing systems without instrumental convergence | Agent foundations, evaluations |
| <EntityLink id="bioweapons">Bioweapons misuse</EntityLink> | Dangerous capability evaluations; refusals and filtering | Evaluations, robustness |
| Cyberweapons misuse | Capability evaluations; secure deployment | Evaluations, control |
| Autonomous replication | ARA evaluations; containment protocols | METR evaluations, control |

## What Needs to Be True

For technical research to substantially reduce x-risk:

1. **Sufficient time:** We have enough time for research to mature before transformative AI
2. **Technical tractability:** Alignment problems have technical solutions
3. **Adoption:** Labs implement research findings in production
4. **Completeness:** Solutions work for the AI systems actually deployed (not just toy models)
5. **Robustness:** Solutions work under competitive pressure and adversarial conditions

|--------|-----------|--------|
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="alignment-robustness" /> | Core research goal: ensure alignment persists as capabilities scale |
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="interpretability-coverage" /> | Mechanistic interpretability enables detection of misalignment |
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="safety-capability-gap" /> | Must outpace capability development to maintain safety margins |
| <EntityLink id="misalignment-potential" /> | <EntityLink id="human-oversight-quality" /> | Scalable oversight and AI control extend human supervision |

Technical research effectiveness depends critically on timelines, adoption, and whether alignment problems are technically tractable.
