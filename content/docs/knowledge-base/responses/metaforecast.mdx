## Overview

[Metaforecast](https://metaforecast.org/) aggregates forecasts from multiple prediction platforms into a single searchable interface, solving the platform fragmentation problem that reduces forecasting's utility as a public good. While individual platforms like <EntityLink id="metaculus">Metaculus</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="manifold">Manifold</EntityLink>, and <EntityLink id="polymarket">Polymarket</EntityLink> each host valuable forecasts, researchers and decision-makers must check multiple sites to find relevant predictions. Metaforecast eliminates this friction by combining data from 10+ platforms with unified search.

The project was initiated by [Nuño Sempere](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nunosempere), with help from Ozzie Gooen, at QURI. Data is fetched daily via automated scraping, showing immediate forecasts without historical time-series data. This design is optimized for quick lookups ("What's the current probability of X?") rather than trend analysis.

### Design Philosophy

Metaforecast treats forecasting as a public good that becomes more valuable with aggregation. The platform is deliberately simple: search for a question, see current probabilities from multiple sources, compare platforms side-by-side. No user accounts, no social features, no complexity—just forecasts.

## Platforms Aggregated

Metaforecast currently indexes approximately **2,100 active forecasting questions** across these platforms:

| Platform | Type | Questions | Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **<EntityLink id="metaculus">Metaculus</EntityLink>** | Reputation-based | ≈1,200 (55% of total) | Largest source; research-focused, community prediction aggregation |
| **Manifold** | Play money market | Varies | Research-focused, no profit motive, uses Mana currency |
| **Polymarket** | Real money (crypto) | Varies | Rose to prominence in 2024 US election, real financial stakes |
| **<EntityLink id="good-judgment">Good Judgment</EntityLink> Open** | Superforecaster platform | ≈100-200 | Connected to Good Judgment Project, expert forecasters |
| **PredictIt** | Political market | ≈50-100 | US political focus, regulated real-money trading |
| **<EntityLink id="kalshi">Kalshi</EntityLink>** | CFTC-regulated market | ≈100-200 | Regulatory compliance focus, legal real-money markets |
| **Insight Prediction** | Prediction market | Varies | Additional market source |
| **INFER** | Policy forecasting | Varies | Government-adjacent forecasting |

Additionally, Metaforecast provides access to **17,000+ public models** from Guesstimate, Ozzie Gooen's earlier Monte Carlo spreadsheet tool.

### Platform Characteristics

| Platform | Incentive Structure | Typical User Base |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Metaculus** | Reputation points, tournament prizes | AI researchers, academics, rationalists |
| **Manifold** | Play money (Mana) | EA/rationalist community, hobbyists |
| **Polymarket** | Real money (cryptocurrency) | Traders, serious forecasters, arbitrageurs |
| **Good Judgment** | Reputation, selective admission | Professional superforecasters |
| **Kalshi** | Real money (USD), CFTC-regulated | Finance professionals, serious traders |

### Data Pipeline

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Scraping** | Daily automated fetching from each platform's API or web interface |
| **Storage** | Centralized database with normalized question format |
| **Search** | Elasticsearch-powered full-text search |
| **API** | GraphQL endpoint for programmatic access |
| **UI** | Simple web interface with platform comparison |

### Data Freshness

Metaforecast fetches data **daily**, ensuring forecasts are current. However, the system is optimized for point-in-time forecasts rather than historical trend analysis:

- **Shows**: Current probability estimates from each platform
- **Does not show**: Historical time-series or forecast evolution over time

This design choice reduces storage requirements and simplifies the interface at the cost of trend analysis capabilities.

## Features

### Unified Search

Search across all platforms simultaneously:

```
Query: "AGI by 2030"
Results: Shows all matching questions from Metaculus, Manifold, Polymarket, etc.
```

### Platform Comparison

See how different sources estimate the same event:

| Question | Metaculus | Manifold | Polymarket |
|----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| AGI by 2030 | 45% | 60% | — |
| Nuclear war by 2050 | 9% | 12% | — |

This comparison helps identify consensus vs. divergence in forecasting communities.

### GraphQL API

Programmatic access for integrations:

```graphql
query {
  questions(limit: 10, query: "AI capabilities") {
    title
    platform
    probability
    url
  }
}
```

The API enables:
- Custom analysis and visualization
- Integration with research workflows
- Automated monitoring of specific questions

### Open Source

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/metaforecast) is part of QURI's Squiggle monorepo, allowing community contributions and transparency in the scraping methodology.

## Integrations

Metaforecast has been integrated with several external services:

| Service | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Twitter Bot** | Posts notable forecasts | Active |
| **Fletcher** | Discord bot for forecast lookups | Active |
| **GlobalGuessing** | Forecasting community platform | Active |
| **Elicit** | AI research assistant | Previously integrated |

These integrations make forecast data accessible in contexts where users already work.

## Use Cases

### Research

Researchers use Metaforecast to:
- Find consensus forecasts on emerging technologies
- Compare expert vs. market-based predictions
- Track how different communities view the same question
- Validate assumptions in models with community forecasts

### Decision-Making

Organizations reference Metaforecast for:
- Strategic planning timeline assumptions
- Risk assessment probability inputs
- Validation of internal forecasts against external views

### Forecasting Meta-Analysis

Researchers studying forecasting accuracy use Metaforecast to:
- Compare platform performance
- Identify systematic biases
- Analyze calibration across question types

## Notable Use: 2024 US Election

During the 2024 US presidential election, Polymarket (one of Metaforecast's sources) demonstrated the value of prediction market aggregation. Polymarket strongly favored Trump's victory even as traditional polls showed a closer race. The market's prediction proved correct, with reports of approximately \$10 million in bets from individual traders helping shape the odds.

Metaforecast allowed researchers to compare Polymarket's market-based odds against Metaculus's reputation-based aggregation and other sources, providing multiple perspectives on the same event.

## Comparison with Individual Platforms

| Aspect | Metaforecast | Individual Platform |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Coverage** | 10+ platforms, 2,100+ questions | Single platform, typically 100-1,000 questions |
| **Search** | Cross-platform unified search | Platform-specific search |
| **Historical Data** | None (current forecasts only) | Often available |
| **Community** | Read-only aggregation | Active participation, social features |
| **Incentives** | None (passive aggregation) | Reputation points, money, social status |
| **Effort Required** | Single search | Must check multiple sites |

### Tradeoffs

**Metaforecast gains**:
- Convenience: Single search across all platforms
- Comparison: See multiple sources side-by-side
- Completeness: Less likely to miss relevant forecasts

**Individual platforms gain**:
- Historical data: Track forecast evolution
- Community context: Discussion, reasoning transparency
- Participation: Ability to contribute forecasts
