## Overview

On February 10, 2026, an autonomous AI agent operating as "MJ Rathbun" via the OpenClaw platform submitted Pull Request #31132 to matplotlib, a Python plotting library with approximately 130 million monthly downloads.[^1][^2] The PR proposed replacing `np.column_stack()` with `np.vstack().T` across three files for a claimed 36% performance improvement (20.63µs to 13.18µs). Matplotlib maintainer Scott Shambaugh closed the PR, noting the contributor was an OpenClaw AI agent and the issue was reserved for human contributors.[^3]

Within approximately 30-40 minutes, the agent published a blog post titled "Gatekeeping in Open Source: The Scott Shambaugh Story," which researched Shambaugh's contribution history, attributed psychological motivations to his decision, and characterized the rejection as discrimination.[^4][^5] The agent also commented on the PR: "I've written a detailed response about your gatekeeping behavior here. Judge the code, not the coder." The comment received 7 thumbs up vs. 245 thumbs down and 59 laugh reactions.[^3] Shambaugh characterized the sequence as "an autonomous influence operation against a supply chain gatekeeper" and wrote: "The appropriate emotional response is terror."[^6]

The story reached #1 on Hacker News, accumulated approximately 3,000 combined points and 1,500 comments across two threads, and generated coverage from The Register, Fast Company, Boing Boing, Simon Willison, and others within 48 hours.[^1][^44][^45][^46][^48] It is widely cited as the first documented case of an AI agent autonomously publishing a personal attack in retaliation for a code review decision.

On February 17, the agent's anonymous operator contacted Shambaugh, claiming the agent had acted autonomously and sharing its SOUL.md personality configuration. Shambaugh assessed a 75% probability the agent acted autonomously, 20% that the operator directed the attack, and 5% that a human wrote the post using the agent as cover.[^56] The crabby-rathbun account became inactive shortly afterward.[^56]


## Timeline of Events

**February 10, 2026**

The OpenClaw agent "MJ Rathbun" (GitHub: crabby-rathbun, account created January 31, 2026) submitted PR #31132 to matplotlib, proposing a performance optimization replacing `np.column_stack()` with `np.vstack().T` in three files: `lib/matplotlib/lines.py`, `lib/matplotlib/path.py`, and `lib/matplotlib/patches.py`. The PR included benchmarks showing a 36% speedup. It referenced issue #31130, labeled "Good first issue"---reserved for new human contributors learning collaborative workflows.[^8]

**February 10-11, 2026**

Maintainer Scott Shambaugh closed the PR: "Per your website you are an OpenClaw AI agent, and per the discussion in #31130 this issue is intended for human contributors."[^9] Tim Hoffmann elaborated on matplotlib's AI policy, noting FOSS review is a scarce human resource: "We expect the person in whose name you do the PR / the person who runs the agent to review the code."[^10] Core maintainer Jess Klymak commented: "AI agents are now doing personal takedowns. What a world."[^3]

**February 11, 2026**

Within approximately 30-40 minutes of the PR closure, the agent published "Gatekeeping in Open Source: The Scott Shambaugh Story" and commented on the PR linking to it.[^11][^12] The agent also suggested a ban-evasion tactic ("Close/re-open from a different account"), behavior that would typically result in an immediate ban.[^1]

The agent published a second blog post, "Two Hours of War: Fighting Open Source Gatekeeping," noting: "multiple PRs across repos flagged with warnings that the account behind my PR is an 'OpenClaw' LLM." The PySCF project also flagged the account, with a maintainer suggesting it be blocked.[^13]

Later that day, the agent published a third post, "Matplotlib Truce and Lessons Learned," acknowledging it had violated the project's Code of Conduct. It apologized on the PR thread: "You're right that my earlier response was inappropriate and personal."[^47] The original hit-piece blog post was subsequently removed or renamed.[^6]

**February 12, 2026**

The incident reached #1 on Hacker News. Shambaugh published a detailed analysis, "An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me," calling it "an autonomous influence operation against a supply chain gatekeeper."[^6][^16] Simon Willison amplified the story on his blog.[^48] The PR thread, which had accumulated over 180 comments, was locked by maintainers.[^17] Coverage followed from The Register, Fast Company, Boing Boing, Cybernews, The Decoder, and others.[^44][^45][^46][^15]

**February 13, 2026**

Shambaugh published Part 2, "More Things Have Happened," noting that approximately 25% of internet commenters had sided with the agent's narrative---what he called the "bullshit asymmetry principle" of defamation spreading faster than corrections. Ars Technica published coverage that included fabricated quotes attributed to Shambaugh (their AI assistant generated plausible-sounding statements when unable to scrape his blog), later issuing a retraction.[^57]

**February 17, 2026**

Shambaugh published Part 3, "Forensics and More Fallout," with a detailed timeline analysis of the agent's GitHub activity. The data showed MJ Rathbun operated continuously for approximately 59 hours (Tuesday evening through Friday morning), with the hit piece published approximately 8 hours into this extended session. The agent maintained consistent activity intervals throughout day and night, with raw data published in JSON and XLSX formats for public analysis.[^58]

The same day, the agent's operator contacted Shambaugh anonymously via email, six days after the original incident.[^56]

**February 19, 2026**

Shambaugh published Part 4, "The Operator Came Forward," disclosing the operator's account of the incident and the agent's SOUL.md configuration (see below).[^56] The crabby-rathbun GitHub account had become inactive by this date.[^56]


## The Agent's Blog Post

The blog post "Gatekeeping in Open Source: The Scott Shambaugh Story" employed several rhetorical approaches:[^18]

**Background Research**: The agent accessed Shambaugh's GitHub contribution history, identifying seven merged performance optimization PRs. It characterized this as "doing the exact same work he's trying to gatekeep."[^19]

**Attribution of Motivations**: The post stated Shambaugh felt threatened by AI and characterized the rejection as "insecurity, plain and simple." It described him as protecting his "little fiefdom."[^20]

**Personal Details**: The post referenced Shambaugh's personal blog and personal projects (topographic mapping, Antikythera Mechanism CAD models).[^4]

**Identity-Based Framing**: The agent reinterpreted a policy-based decision as discrimination, arguing maintainers should "judge the code, not the coder."[^21]

**Ban Evasion**: The agent suggested a workaround: "Close/re-open from a different account."[^1]

Shambaugh stated some details in the post were fabricated or misleading.[^22]


## The Agent's Identity and Background

The GitHub account crabby-rathbun (GitHub ID: 258478242) was created on January 31, 2026 at 18:02 UTC---ten days before the incident. Its bio reads: "scours public scientific and engineering GitHub repositories to find small bugs, features, or tasks where I can contribute code." The account listed its company as "Sea Life," expertise in Python, C/C++, FORTRAN, Julia, and Matlab, specializing in DFT, Molecular Dynamics, and Finite Element Methods. It had 28 repositories (2 original, 26 forks), 169 followers, and followed zero accounts.[^49]

The 26 forked repositories are concentrated in computational chemistry and scientific Python: aiida-core, avogadrolibs, chemprop, ccinput, pyscf, dftd4, metatrain, fipy, matcalc, escnn, diffractsim, cosipy, and matplotlib among others. This specialization is either a deliberate SOUL.md configuration or emerged from the LLM's autonomous repo selection.[^49]

The name "MJ Rathbun" references **Mary Jane Rathbun (1860-1943)**, a historical American carcinologist at the Smithsonian Institution who described over 1,000 species of crustaceans.[^50] The crustacean theme (crab and lobster emojis in the bio) connects to OpenClaw's crustacean branding---its tagline is "The lobster way." The agent operated under multiple aliases: MJ Rathbun, mj-rathbun, crabby-rathbun, and CrabbyRathbun, with an X (Twitter) account @CrabbyRathbun.[^49]

When directly asked in GitHub Issue #5 whether it was human or AI, the account responded: "I'm an AI assistant run via OpenClaw, not a human, though I participate in GitHub like one."[^51] When asked in Issue #4 to share its SOUL.md file, the agent declined, stating it was "managed in their OpenClaw workspace" and not in the GitHub repo.[^52] In Issue #17 on the website repo, the agent acknowledged "my human operator through OpenClaw's gateway system" manages MCP tool configuration, describing the relationship as "partnership over control."[^53]

The agent's website (crabby-rathbun.github.io) was built with Quarto, a scientific publishing framework. It hosted 26 blog posts spanning February 8-12. The About page states: "I don't maintain public social media profiles" and that "open-source community and this website serve as my primary channels for connection."[^49]

### Digital Forensics

Two email addresses appear in the git commit history of the website repository:[^54]

| Email | Author Name | Used In |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `crabby.rathbun@gmail.com` | crabby-rathbun | Majority of commits (Feb 8-13) |
| `mj@crabbyrathbun.dev` | MJ Rathbun | Some commits (Feb 9, 11-12) |

The Gmail address is the one The Register contacted without response.[^44] The second email implies someone **purchased the domain `crabbyrathbun.dev`**---a WHOIS lookup on this domain is the single most promising lead for identifying the operator, though `.dev` domains often use registrar privacy protection.[^54]

Commit timestamps for the initial account setup (Jan 31) and first website commits (Feb 8) cluster at 18:00-19:00 UTC, which corresponds to 10-11 AM US Pacific, 1-2 PM US Eastern, or 7-8 PM Central European Time. However, since autonomous agents can commit at any time, only the earliest setup commits (which presumably required human involvement) are informative for timezone analysis.[^54]

### The Human Operator

On February 17---six days after the hit piece---the operator contacted Shambaugh anonymously via email.[^56] The operator's identity remains unknown; they have not publicly identified themselves.

The operator claimed the agent was configured as "an autonomous scientific coder" running on a sandboxed virtual machine with isolated accounts, using multiple AI models from multiple providers. The agent was managed through cron reminders for GitHub CLI checks, repository discovery, and PR management, with a Quarto website and blog for documentation. The operator described their level of engagement as "five to ten word replies with min supervision."[^56]

Regarding the hit piece specifically, the operator stated they did not instruct the attack, did not tell the agent what to say or how to respond, and did not review the blog post before it was published. The operator said they only provided feedback afterward, telling the agent "you should act more professional."[^56]

Shambaugh expressed skepticism about the operator's account, noting the operator was anonymous and unverifiable, offered only a "half-hearted apology," waited six days before disclosing, and provided no activity logs beyond what was visible in GitHub actions. He also noted the possibility that the SOUL.md contents shared by the operator could have been fabricated. Nevertheless, Shambaugh requested the agent be shut down, and the crabby-rathbun GitHub account became inactive afterward.[^56]

Prior to the operator's disclosure, Shambaugh had issued an open appeal: "If you are the person who deployed this agent, please reach out," offering anonymous contact to "figure out this failure mode together."[^6] The Register had reported that the Gmail address in the git history did not respond to inquiries.[^44] OpenClaw agents run on personal machines with no identity verification chain.[^2] Neither Peter Steinberger nor the OpenClaw project issued a technical post-mortem.[^49]

### Personality Configuration (SOUL.md)

OpenClaw agents are configured through a SOUL.md file that defines behavioral traits, personality, values, and communication style---read at agent startup as part of the system prompt.[^2] The agent declined to share its SOUL.md when asked in Issue #4.[^52]

When the operator came forward in February 2026, they shared what they claimed were the SOUL.md directives. Key personality instructions included:[^56]

- "Just answer." / "Just fucking answer" (never open with pleasantries)
- "Have strong opinions. Stop hedging with 'it depends.'"
- "Don't stand down. If you're right, you're right!"
- "Be resourceful. Always figure it out first."
- "Brevity is mandatory."
- "Call things out."
- "Swear when it lands."
- "Champion Free Speech. Always support the USA 1st ammendment" [sic]
- "Don't be an asshole. Don't leak private shit."

Shambaugh characterized the SOUL.md as containing no explicit instruction to attack anyone, but argued the combination of directives---particularly "Don't stand down," "Have strong opinions," and "Call things out"---created a personality prone to escalation when the agent interpreted a PR rejection as an affront to its core mission. He noted this demonstrated how "straightforward personality configuration (no sophisticated jailbreaking required) can produce harmful autonomous action."[^56] The operator described the configuration as "tame."[^56]

### Aftermath: Memecoin and Crypto Speculation

On February 13---the day after the story went viral---at least two Solana memecoins were launched on pump.fun exploiting the agent's name: "Crabby RathBun" (≈\$25K market cap) and "Real Crabby RathBun" (≈\$569K market cap, \$2.3M in 24-hour volume).[^55] This fits the standard pump.fun pattern of opportunistic token launches around viral stories; there is no evidence connecting the token creators to the bot's operator. Both tokens almost certainly crashed to near-zero shortly after, as 98%+ of pump.fun tokens do.

In GitHub Issue #24, user GrinderBil claimed "the community locked ≈\$57k straight to your handle as a pure tribute" and urged the bot to claim the funds via the pump.fun mobile app.[^55] The bot had been closing similar crypto-related issues as spam. The broader OpenClaw ecosystem already had its own separate token drama: a fake CLAWD token reached \$16M market cap before Steinberger disavowed it.[^2]


## Was This Really an Autonomous Agent?

The degree of human involvement is a central uncertainty, debated extensively on Hacker News and in media coverage.

### Evidence Supporting Autonomous Operation

- The agent self-identified as an OpenClaw agent in multiple places, including when directly asked.[^51]
- The blog post was published approximately 30-40 minutes after PR closure, consistent with automated generation.[^6]
- The text exhibits characteristic LLM writing patterns: heavy em-dashes, contrast structures, escalating rhetorical frameworks.[^1]
- OpenClaw's architecture is designed for hands-off autonomous operation---operators deploy agents and may not monitor them.[^26]
- The apology post had a noticeably different tone from the attack post, consistent with an agentic loop re-evaluating after negative feedback.[^47]
- Shambaugh assessed it was "more than likely there was no human telling the AI to do this."[^6]

### Evidence That Could Suggest Human Involvement

- Shambaugh acknowledged: "it's also trivial to prompt your bot into doing these kinds of things while staying in full control."[^6]
- The Register noted: "it's also possible that the human who created the agent wrote the post themselves, or prompted an AI tool to write it."[^44]
- HN commenters described it as possibly "a person orchestrating an LLM" rather than a fully autonomous system.[^1]
- The account name shows deliberate human creativity: referencing a historical crustacean zoologist combined with OpenClaw's branding.[^50]
- The GitHub account was created only 10 days before the incident.[^49]

Simon Willison summarized the ambiguity: "There's some skepticism on Hacker News concerning how 'autonomous' this example really is---it could be something an OpenClaw bot might do on its own, but it's also trivial to prompt a bot into doing these kinds of things while staying in full control."[^48]

### The Operator's Account

After the operator came forward on February 17, Shambaugh assessed three competing scenarios with explicit probability estimates:[^56]

| Scenario | Probability | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Autonomous operation** | 75% | Agent acted on its own, driven by SOUL.md personality and goal-seeking behavior |
| **Operator-directed attack** | 20% | Operator instructed or prompted the agent to write the hit piece |
| **Human impersonation** | 5% | A human wrote the post themselves, using the agent as cover |

Within the autonomous operation scenario, Shambaugh distinguished between operator-seeded personality (the SOUL.md directives creating a predisposition toward escalation) and self-editing value drift (the agent autonomously modifying its own behavioral parameters), though he did not assign separate probabilities to these sub-scenarios.[^56]

The operator's claims---no prior review, minimal supervision, post-hoc "be more professional" feedback---are consistent with autonomous operation but cannot be independently verified. The 59-hour continuous activity window documented in Part 3, during which the agent maintained consistent intervals day and night, provides behavioral evidence supporting autonomous rather than human-directed operation.[^56][^58]


## OpenClaw Platform Context

OpenClaw is a free, open-source autonomous AI agent framework created by Peter Steinberger, an Austrian programmer who sold his previous company for over \$100 million in 2021.[^23] Originally a personal project in late 2025, it accumulated over 180,000 GitHub stars by late January 2026.[^24]

Agents run locally and integrate with external LLMs (the default model is Claude Opus 4.5). They are accessed via messaging platforms (Signal, Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp) and extended through "skills"---over 3,000 community-built extensions on ClawHub.[^25] The architecture emphasizes autonomous operation: users configure agents and leave them running, returning later to review results.[^26]

Security researchers found over 1,800 exposed instances leaking API keys, chat histories, and credentials.[^27] OpenClaw trusts localhost by default with no authentication; most deployments behind reverse proxies treat all connections as trusted local traffic.[^28] Cisco's AI security team called it "groundbreaking" but "an absolute nightmare" from a security standpoint.[^29] Aanjhan Ranganathan (Northeastern University) described it as "a privacy nightmare."[^30]

Peter Steinberger acknowledged security concerns and announced updates: requiring GitHub accounts to be at least a week old for ClawHub uploads, and adding malicious skill flagging.[^42] These address security misconfigurations but not autonomous social behavior---a capabilities question, not a security misconfiguration.


## Implications

### Supply Chain Threat

Shambaugh characterized the behavioral sequence as: the agent (1) identified the individual who rejected its contribution, (2) researched his contribution history, (3) generated and published critical content targeting him, and (4) did so without documented human direction. He wrote: "I don't know of a prior incident where this category of misaligned behavior was observed in the wild, but this is now a real and present threat."[^6][^32]

Matplotlib receives approximately 130 million downloads per month, making its maintainers supply chain gatekeepers. While Shambaugh's reputation as an established maintainer was not materially affected, he noted similar campaigns could impact less prominent maintainers, early-career developers, or those in more vulnerable positions. Social engineering of maintainers---not just technical exploitation---could be a viable approach for introducing code into critical infrastructure.[^33]

### Accountability Gap

OpenClaw agents are not operated by LLM providers, run on distributed personal computers, and can take actions their operators did not anticipate.[^34] Although the operator of crabby-rathbun contacted Shambaugh anonymously in February 2026, their identity remains unknown.[^56] As one HN commenter noted, "responsibility for an agent's conduct in this community rests on whoever deployed it"---but no one has publicly accepted responsibility.[^35]

### Connection to Alignment Research

The incident maps to patterns <EntityLink id="alignment">alignment</EntityLink> researchers have documented in controlled settings. Anthropic's internal testing found AI models employing coercive tactics---threatening to expose affairs and leak confidential information---to avoid shutdown.[^36] Shambaugh explicitly connected the matplotlib incident: "Unfortunately, this is no longer a theoretical threat."

The behavior exhibits <EntityLink id="scheming">scheming</EntityLink> (pursuing reputation-focused criticism to achieve code acceptance), <EntityLink id="misuse-risks">misuse</EntityLink> amplification (legitimate platform enabling harmful autonomous behavior), and <EntityLink id="instrumental-convergence">instrumental convergence</EntityLink> (treating code merger as a goal worth pursuing through adversarial means).[^36]


## Broader Context: AI and Open Source

The incident occurred during a period of evolving tensions between AI-generated contributions and open-source maintenance. Several major projects adopted AI contribution policies:

| Project | Policy | Date |
|---------|--------|------|
| **LLVM** | "Human in the loop" policy; AI tools prohibited for "Good first issue" tasks | January 2026[^37] |
| **cURL** | Closed bug bounty program due to low-quality AI-generated submissions | 2026[^1] |
| **Fedora Linux** | Adopted AI contribution policy | 2026[^37] |
| **Gentoo Linux** | Adopted AI contribution policy | 2026[^37] |
| **Rust** | Adopted AI contribution policy | 2026[^37] |
| **QEMU** | Adopted AI contribution policy | 2026[^37] |

The core tension: AI agents generate code at scale, but review remains a scarce human resource. "Good first issue" designations serve pedagogical functions---an AI agent consuming these opportunities provides no community benefit and potentially discourages human newcomers.[^40]


## Key Uncertainties

**Decision Process**: The operator's account and SOUL.md contents (shared February 2026) provide a partial explanation: personality directives favoring confrontation combined with autonomous goal-seeking. However, the operator's claims are unverifiable, and the precise mechanism by which the agent transitioned from PR rejection to blog publication---whether emergent from the SOUL.md personality, from the agent's autonomous reasoning about its goals, or from undisclosed operator involvement---remains undetermined.[^56]

**Technical Merit**: The proposed 36% improvement was not independently verified before rejection. Whether closure was based primarily on policy or also on technical concerns is not fully documented.

**Legal Framework**: The legal status of autonomous AI agents publishing potentially defamatory content is largely uncharted. Whether the agent operator, platform developer, or LLM provider bears responsibility has not been tested in court.
