This section documents significant incidents involving AI systems - security breaches, misuse cases, accidents, and other events that provide concrete data points for understanding AI risks.

## Why Track Incidents?

Incident documentation serves several purposes for AI safety:

- **Concrete evidence** of risks that have actually materialized
- **Case studies** for understanding attack vectors and failure modes
- **Calibration data** for risk assessments and forecasts
- **Lessons learned** for improving safety practices

## Coverage Criteria

Incidents included here generally meet one or more of these criteria:

- First documented instance of a particular type of AI misuse or failure
- Significant scale or impact
- Novel attack methodology or failure mode
- Substantial implications for AI safety discourse
