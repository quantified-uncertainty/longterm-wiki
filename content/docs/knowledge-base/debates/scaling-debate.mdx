title: "Is Scaling All You Need?"
description: "The scaling debate examines whether current AI approaches will reach AGI through more compute and data, or require new paradigms. By 2025, evidence is mixed: o3 achieved 87.5% on ARC-AGI-1, but GPT-5 took 2 years longer than expected and ARC-AGI-2 remains unsolved by all models. The emerging consensus favors 'scaling-plus'—combining pretraining with reasoning via test-time compute."

**Scaling hypothesis**: Current deep learning approaches will reach human-level and superhuman intelligence through:
- More compute (bigger models, longer training)
- More data (larger, higher-quality datasets)
- Better engineering (efficiency improvements)

**New paradigms hypothesis**: We need fundamentally different approaches because current methods hit fundamental limits.

## What Would Change Minds?

**For scaling optimists to update toward skepticism:**
- Scaling 100x with only marginal capability improvements
- Hitting hard data or compute walls
- Proof that key capabilities (planning, causality) can't emerge from current architectures
- Persistent failures on simple reasoning despite increasing scale

**For skeptics to update toward scaling:**
- GPT-5/6 showing qualitatively new reasoning capabilities
- Solving ARC or other generalization benchmarks via pure scaling
- Continued emergent abilities at each scale-up
- Clear path around data limitations

## The Data Wall

A critical constraint on scaling is the availability of training data. [Epoch AI research](https://epoch.ai/blog/will-we-run-out-of-data-limits-of-llm-scaling-based-on-human-generated-data) projects that high-quality human-generated text will be exhausted between 2026-2030, depending on training efficiency.

### Data Availability Projections

| Data Source | Current Usage | Exhaustion Timeline | Mitigation |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| High-quality web text | ≈300B tokens/year | 2026-2028 | Quality filtering, multimodal |
| Books and academic papers | ≈10% utilized | 2028-2030 | OCR improvements, licensing |
| Code repositories | ≈50B tokens/year | 2027-2029 | Synthetic generation |
| Multimodal (video, audio) | Under 5% utilized | 2030+ | [Epoch AI](https://epoch.ai/blog/can-ai-scaling-continue-through-2030): Could 3x available data |
| Synthetic data | Nascent | Unlimited potential | [Microsoft SynthLLM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/synthllm-breaking-the-ai-data-wall-with-scalable-synthetic-data/): Performance plateaus at 300B tokens |

[Elon Musk stated in 2024](https://ncfacanada.org/musk-says-human-data-for-ai-training-is-depleted/) that AI has "already exhausted all human-generated publicly available data." However, Anthropic's position is that "data quality and quantity challenges are a solvable problem rather than a fundamental limitation," with synthetic data remaining "highly promising."

### The Synthetic Data Question

A key uncertainty is whether synthetic data can substitute for human-generated data. Research shows mixed results:

- **Positive**: [Microsoft's SynthLLM](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/synthllm-breaking-the-ai-data-wall-with-scalable-synthetic-data/) demonstrates scaling laws hold for synthetic data
- **Negative**: A [Nature study](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/12/data-ai-training-synthetic/) found that "abusing" synthetic data leads to "irreversible defects" and "model collapse" after a few generations
- **Nuanced**: Performance improvements plateau at approximately 300B synthetic tokens

## Implications for AI Safety

This debate has major implications for AI safety strategy, resource allocation, and policy priorities.

### Timeline and Strategy Implications

| Scenario | AGI Timeline | Safety Research Priority | Policy Urgency |
|----------|--------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Scaling works** | 5-10 years | LLM alignment, RLHF improvements | Critical: Must act now |
| **Scaling-plus** | 8-15 years | Reasoning model safety, scalable oversight | High: 5-10 year window |
| **New paradigms** | 15-30+ years | Broader alignment theory, unknown architectures | Moderate: Time to prepare |
| **Hybrid** | 10-20 years | Both LLM and novel approaches | High: Uncertainty requires robustness |

**If scaling works:**
- Short timelines (AGI within 5-10 years)
- Predictable capability trajectory
- Safety research can focus on aligning scaled-up LLMs
- Winner-take-all dynamics (whoever scales most wins)

**If new paradigms needed:**
- Longer timelines (10-30+ years)
- More uncertainty about capability trajectory
- Safety research needs to consider unknown architectures
- More opportunity for safety-by-default designs

**Hybrid scenario (emerging consensus):**
- Medium timelines (5-15 years)
- Some predictability, some surprises
- Safety research should cover both scaled LLMs and new architectures
- The [o1/o3 reasoning paradigm](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/) suggests this is the most likely path

### Resource Allocation Implications

The debate affects billions of dollars in investment decisions:

- **Stargate Project**: [\$500B committed through 2029](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/) by <EntityLink id="openai">OpenAI</EntityLink>, SoftBank, Oracle—implicitly betting on scaling
- **<EntityLink id="meta-ai">Meta</EntityLink>'s LLM focus**: [<EntityLink id="yann-lecun">Yann LeCun</EntityLink>'s November 2025 departure](https://fortune.com/2026/01/23/deepmind-demis-hassabis-anthropic-dario-amodei-yann-lecun-ai-davos/) to found Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs signals internal disagreement
- **<EntityLink id="deepmind">DeepMind</EntityLink>'s approach**: Combines scaling with algorithmic innovation (AlphaFold, Gemini)—hedging both sides

## Historical Parallels

**Cases where scaling worked:**
- ImageNet → Deep learning revolution (2012)
- GPT-2 → GPT-3 → GPT-4 trajectory
- AlphaGo scaling to AlphaZero
- Transformer scaling unlocking new capabilities

**Cases where new paradigms were needed:**
- Perceptrons → Neural networks (needed backprop + hidden layers)
- RNNs → Transformers (needed attention mechanism)
- Expert systems → Statistical learning (needed paradigm shift)

The question: Which pattern are we in now?

## 2024-2025: The Scaling Debate Intensifies

The past two years have provided significant new evidence, though interpretation remains contested.

### Key Developments

| Date | Event | Implications |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Sep 2024 | OpenAI releases o1 reasoning model | New scaling paradigm: test-time compute |
| Dec 2024 | o3 achieves 87.5% on ARC-AGI-1 | [ARC Prize](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough): "Surprising step-function increase" |
| Dec 2024 | [Ilya Sutskever NeurIPS speech](https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/generative-ai-scaling-agi-deep-learning/) | "Pretraining as we know it will end" |
| Feb 2025 | [GPT-5 pivot revealed](https://fortune.com/2025/02/25/what-happened-gpt-5-openai-orion-pivot-scaling-pre-training-llm-agi-reasoning/) | 2-year delay; pure pretraining ceiling hit |
| May 2025 | [ARC-AGI-2 benchmark launched](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi) | All frontier models score under 5%; humans 100% |
| Aug 2025 | GPT-5 released | [Performance gains](https://aicommission.org/2025/08/gpt-5-is-finally-here-can-it-put-openai-back-on-top/) mainly from inference-time reasoning |
| Nov 2025 | [Yann LeCun leaves Meta](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/meta-large-language-models-will-not-get-to-human-level-intelligence/) | Founds AMI Labs to pursue world models |
| Jan 2026 | [Davos AI debates](https://fortune.com/2026/01/23/deepmind-demis-hassabis-anthropic-dario-amodei-yann-lecun-ai-davos/) | Hassabis vs LeCun on AGI timelines |

### The Reasoning Revolution

The emergence of "reasoning models" in 2024-2025 partially resolved the debate by introducing a new scaling paradigm:

- **Test-time compute scaling**: [OpenAI observed](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/openais-o3-the-2024-finale-of-ai) that reinforcement learning exhibits "more compute = better performance" trends similar to pretraining
- **o3 benchmark results**: 96.7% on AIME 2024, 87.7% on GPQA Diamond, 71.7% on SWE-bench Verified (vs o1's 48.9%)
- **Key insight**: Rather than scaling model parameters, scale inference-time reasoning through reinforcement learning

This suggests a "scaling-plus" resolution: pure pretraining scaling has diminishing returns, but new scaling regimes (reasoning, test-time compute) can unlock continued progress.

### Expert Positions Have Shifted

[Around 75% of AI experts](https://www.metaintro.com/blog/ai-scaling-debate) don't believe scaling LLMs alone will lead to AGI—but many now believe scaling *reasoning* could work:
