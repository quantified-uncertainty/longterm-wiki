llmSummary: "Presents two core cruxes in the AI x-risk debate: whether advanced AI would develop dangerous goals (instrumental convergence vs. trainable safety) and whether we'll get warning signs (gradual failures vs. deception/fast takeoff). No quantitative analysis, primary sources, or novel framing provided."

This is the foundational question in AI safety. Everything else depends on whether you believe AI could actually pose existential risk.
