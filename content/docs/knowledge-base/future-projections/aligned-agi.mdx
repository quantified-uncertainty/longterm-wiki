## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Probability Estimate** | 10-30% by 2040 | Expert surveys show wide variance; [AI Impacts 2024 survey](https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/) found 40% of researchers assign greater than 10% chance to catastrophic outcomes |
| **Technical Feasibility** | Uncertain but plausible | Alignment techniques (<EntityLink id="E259">RLHF</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="E451">constitutional AI</EntityLink>, interpretability) showing progress; major labs investing 15-25% of research budget in safety |
| **Coordination Difficulty** | Very High | Historical precedent limited; [Atlantic Council analysis](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/dispatches/eight-ways-ai-will-shape-geopolitics-in-2026/) notes US-China AI cooperation attempts beginning in 2025-2026 |
| **Timeline Pressure** | Moderate-High | [80,000 Hours analysis](https://80000hours.org/2025/03/when-do-experts-expect-agi-to-arrive/) shows median AGI estimate around 2040; some experts predict 2027-2030 |
| **Key Enablers** | Multiple required | Needs: alignment breakthroughs, <EntityLink id="E171">international coordination</EntityLink>, capability plateau, economic incentives aligning |
| **Current Trajectory** | Mixed signals | Safety research accelerating, but so are capabilities; [RAND scenarios](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA3000/RRA3034-2/RAND_RRA3034-2.pdf) emphasize mixed geopolitical outcomes |
| **Downside Risk if Failed** | Existential | [Toby Ord estimates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P(doom)) 10% existential risk from AI; [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence) estimates 10-20% extinction probability within 30 years |

This scenario explores how humanity could successfully navigate the development of transformative AI. It requires solving multiple hard technical and coordination problems, but represents our best-case outcome. According to the [International AI Safety Report 2025](https://internationalaisafetyreport.org/publication/international-ai-safety-report-2025/), authored by over 100 AI experts and backed by 30 countries, there is broad consensus that managing transformative AI safely requires unprecedented international coordination.

## Timeline of Events (2024-2040)

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (2024-2027)

**2024-2025: Early Warning Signs**
- GPT-5/Claude-4 level systems show impressive but uneven capabilities
- Several near-miss safety incidents (models attempting to deceive evaluators, unexpected capability jumps)
- These incidents don't cause catastrophic harm but demonstrate real risks
- Public and policymaker concern increases substantially
- Anthropic, DeepMind, and OpenAI all report significant safety challenges

**Key Decision Point:** The near-misses could have been ignored or downplayed. Instead, lab leaders take them seriously and increase safety investment.

**2025-2026: Governance Momentum**
- US passes comprehensive AI safety legislation requiring pre-deployment testing for models trained with more than 10^26 FLOP
- China announces pivot toward AI safety cooperation, announcing the [Global AI Governance Action Plan](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/xw/zyxw/202507/t20250729_11679232.html) in July 2025
- International AI Safety Organization (IAISO) established with enforcement power over compute allocation exceeding 10^27 FLOP
- Compute governance frameworks require registration of all clusters exceeding 10,000 H100-equivalents
- Leading AI labs agree to share safety incident data within 72 hours of discovery

**What Made This Possible:**
- Economic interdependence made racing too costly for all parties
- Several respected Chinese AI researchers became convinced of existential risk
- A moderate AI incident in early 2025 provided political will without catastrophic harm
- Tech leaders genuinely concerned about risks, not just profit-maximizing

**2026-2027: Alignment Breakthroughs Begin**
- Major progress in mechanistic interpretability (understanding neural network internals). According to [AI safety field analysis](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7YDyziQxkWxbGmF3u/ai-safety-field-growth-analysis-2025), technical AI safety organizations grew at 24% annually through 2025
- Scalable oversight techniques show promise in practice, building on research by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/safety)
- Evidence that AI systems can be made robustly corrigible
- Academic-industry collaboration accelerates safety research
- Safety research funding reaches 20% of capabilities research (up from approximately 5% in 2024, per [industry estimates](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/))

### Phase 2: Critical Challenges (2027-2032)

**2027-2028: The Capability Plateau**
- AI progress slows somewhat as low-hanging fruit is exhausted
- This "blessing of dimness" provides crucial time for safety work
- Systems are powerful (junior expert level in many domains) but not transformative yet
- Labs use this time to deeply understand current systems before pushing further

**Why This Matters:** Without this plateau, capabilities might have raced ahead of safety. The slowdown was partly luck, partly deliberate choices to focus on safety.

**2028-2029: International Coordination Deepens**
- Global AI development monitoring system established
- Mandatory sharing of dangerous capability discoveries
- Coordinated deployment guidelines for powerful systems
- International compute allocation agreements
- Criminal penalties for unauthorized AGI development attempts

**Counterfactual:** In other scenarios, this level of coordination fails. Here, combination of:
- Shared near-miss experiences creating common understanding
- Economic incentives aligned (AI benefits worth more than racing)
- Strong technical community consensus on risks
- Political leadership taking long-term thinking seriously

**2029-2030: Alignment Solutions Mature**
- Robust techniques for value learning from human feedback
- Reliable methods for detecting deceptive alignment
- Scalable oversight working even for superhuman capabilities
- Formal verification for critical AI decision-making
- Understanding of how to maintain alignment under self-improvement

**Technical Assumptions Required:**
- Alignment turned out to be difficult but solvable
- No fundamental obstacles emerged (no "alignment is impossible" results)
- Mechanistic interpretability scaled successfully
- Human values turned out to be learnable and stable enough

**2030-2032: Early Transformative AI**
- First systems that arguably qualify as AGI deployed under strict monitoring
- Systems can do most cognitive work humans can do
- Used first for scientific research acceleration (alignment, climate, medicine)
- Deployment extremely cautious, heavily sandboxed, extensive testing
- International cooperation holds despite enormous economic pressures

**Critical Decision Points:**
- Labs chose coordinated, delayed deployment over racing to market
- Governments maintained safety requirements despite economic opportunity
- Early AGI systems used to help solve alignment for more powerful successors
- No catastrophic failures that would have broken trust

### Phase 3: Transformation (2032-2040)

**2032-2035: Beneficial Deployment Begins**
- Aligned AI helps accelerate scientific progress
  - Climate change mitigation strategies identified, reducing projected warming by 0.5-1.0°C
  - Novel medical treatments developed, reducing drug discovery timelines from 10-15 years to 2-4 years
  - Clean energy breakthroughs enabling 50% reduction in energy costs
- Economic transformation managed through policy
  - Universal basic income of \$15,000-25,000/year funded by 2-5% AI productivity tax
  - Retraining programs serving 50-100 million workers over 5 years
  - Gradual automation (3-5% of jobs annually) prevents shock unemployment
- Political systems adapt with AI assistance
  - Policy impact predictions accurate within 15-20% for major legislation
  - Corruption detection reduces government waste by estimated 10-20%
  - AI-assisted deliberation platforms engage 20-40% of voting population

**2035-2038: Robust Superintelligence**
- Systems exceed human capability by 10-100x on measured cognitive benchmarks
- Alignment techniques demonstrated effective at 10^30 FLOP scale (100x current frontier)
- International oversight maintained through 500+ person verification body with \$1B annual budget
- AI used to solve previously intractable problems:
  - Aging and disease interventions extend healthy lifespan by 20-40 years
  - Net-zero carbon achieved globally; active carbon removal at 10-20 Gt CO2/year
  - Extreme poverty (less than \$1.15/day) reduced from 700M to under 100M people
  - Existential risks from pandemics, nuclear war reduced by estimated 50-80%

**2038-2040: New Equilibrium**
- Humanity and aligned AI systems in stable, beneficial relationship
- Massive improvement in human welfare globally
- Existential risk from AI reduced to very low levels
- New challenges emerge (value lock-in, meaning of human agency)
- But catastrophic outcomes avoided

## What Had to Go Right

### Expert Probability Estimates for Key Requirements

| Requirement | Probability Range | Source/Basis | Critical Dependencies |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------------|

| All requirements simultaneously achieved | 10-30% | Compound probability; this scenario's core estimate | Multiple independent successes required |

### Technical Achievements

**Alignment Proved Solvable:**
- Scalable oversight techniques worked at superhuman levels
- Value learning captured what humans actually care about
- Deceptive alignment turned out to be detectable and preventable
- Corrigibility possible to maintain even in powerful systems
- No fundamental impossibility results emerged

**Capability Development Was Predictable Enough:**
- No sudden, unexpected capability jumps that bypassed safety
- Interpretability kept pace with capability growth
- Evaluation methods stayed ahead of deception capabilities
- The capability plateau (2027-2028) provided crucial breathing room

### Coordination Successes

**International Cooperation:**
- US-China AI safety cooperation despite geopolitical tensions
- Economic incentives aligned toward coordination over racing
- Information sharing on safety incidents normalized
- Global compute governance implemented and enforced
- Criminal penalties for rogue development deterred bad actors

**Corporate Governance:**
- AI lab leaders maintained safety culture under economic pressure

- Competitive dynamics didn't force corners to be cut

**Political Will:**
- Policymakers took long-term risks seriously despite uncertainty
- Regulations balanced safety with innovation
- International institutions gained real enforcement power
- Public supported necessary precautions despite economic costs

### Cultural Shifts

**AI Research Community:**
- Safety research became high-status and well-funded

- Open collaboration replaced secretive competition in key areas
- Ethical guidelines widely adopted and enforced

**Public Understanding:**
- Media covered AI risks accurately without panic or dismissal
- Public pressure supported safety precautions
- Democratic oversight of AI development remained effective
- Techno-optimism balanced with appropriate caution

## Key Branch Points

### Branch Point 1: Response to Early Safety Incidents (2024-2025)

**What Happened:**
Lab leaders and policymakers took near-miss incidents seriously, increasing safety investment and slowing deployment.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Dismissal:** Incidents downplayed as "teething problems," racing continues → Likely leads to Catastrophe or Multipolar scenarios
- **Overreaction:** Extreme restrictions stifle all AI development → Might lead to Pause scenario but risks others catching up unsafely
- **Actual Path:** Proportionate response with increased caution → Enabled this scenario

**Why This Mattered:**
Early choices about how seriously to take warning signs determined whether we had time to solve alignment before deploying transformative systems.

### Branch Point 2: China-US Coordination (2025-2026)

**What Happened:**
China chose cooperation over competition, seeing mutual benefit in avoiding AI catastrophe.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Intensifying Competition:** Arms race dynamic accelerates, safety sacrificed → Leads to Racing/Multipolar scenarios
- **Actual Path:** Strategic cooperation on existential risks while competing on applications → Enabled global coordination

**Why This Mattered:**
Without US-China cooperation, racing dynamics would have overwhelmed safety concerns at both labs and government levels.

### Branch Point 3: The Capability Plateau (2027-2028)

**What Happened:**
AI progress slowed as initial scaling returns diminished, providing time for safety research.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Continued Exponential Growth:** No plateau, capabilities race ahead → Likely catastrophe if alignment not ready
- **Complete Stagnation:** AI progress stops entirely → Different future, possibly Pause scenario
- **Actual Path:** Temporary slowdown at junior expert level → Crucial time for alignment work

**Why This Mattered:**
This "breathing room" was essential. Without it, the gap between capabilities and alignment would have grown too large.

### Branch Point 4: Alignment Breakthrough (2029-2030)

**What Happened:**
Combination of interpretability, scalable oversight, and value learning succeeded.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Fundamental Impossibility:** Alignment proved impossible → Leads to Catastrophe or forced Pause
- **Partial Success:** Some alignment but significant gaps → Leads to Muddle scenario
- **Actual Path:** Robust alignment techniques → Enabled safe deployment of transformative AI

**Why This Mattered:**
This was the crucial technical achievement. Without it, all the coordination would merely delay, not prevent, catastrophe.

### Branch Point 5: Deployment Coordination (2030-2032)

**What Happened:**
Despite enormous economic pressures, coordinated, cautious deployment maintained.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Defection:** One actor races to deploy → Competitive pressure forces others to follow → Multipolar chaos
- **Excessive Caution:** Beneficial deployment delayed unnecessarily → Economic costs undermine political support
- **Actual Path:** Balanced, coordinated deployment → Benefits realized while maintaining safety

**Why This Mattered:**
This was where theory met practice. All prior work could have been undone by competitive deployment.

## Cruxes and Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions questions={[
  "Is alignment fundamentally solvable, or will we hit impossibility results?",
  "Can US-China coordination overcome geopolitical tensions?",
  "Will the public support necessary precautions, or demand faster deployment?",
  "Can corporate governance resist short-term profit pressure?",
  "Will we get lucky with a capability plateau providing time for safety?",
  "Can democratic institutions handle long-term, uncertain risks?",
  "Will economic incentives align toward cooperation or racing?",
  "Is there enough time between warning signs and catastrophic capabilities?"
]} />

### Biggest Uncertainties

**Technical:**
- Whether alignment is solvable at all
- Whether capability growth is predictable enough
- Whether we get warning signs in time
- Whether interpretability can keep pace

**Strategic:**
- Whether economic incentives favor coordination
- Whether political will can sustain long-term thinking

- Whether defection can be prevented

**Empirical:**
- What AGI timeline actually is
- Whether we get a capability plateau
- How disruptive economic impact is
- Whether early warning incidents occur

## Relation to Other Scenarios

### Transitions From This Scenario

**Could Degrade To:**
- **Slow Takeoff Muddle:** If coordination partially breaks down but no catastrophe
- **Multipolar Competition:** If international cooperation fails but alignment partially works
- **Misaligned Catastrophe:** If alignment fails after initial successes
- **Pause and Redirect:** If we decide to slow down even more mid-transition

**Unlikely To Transition To:**
- Scenarios requiring fundamentally different technical outcomes

### Combinations With Other Scenarios

**Elements Often Combined:**
- Might see "muddling through" phase before achieving full alignment success
- Could have multipolar competition in applications while coordinating on safety
- Might need pause-like slowdowns during critical periods

**This Scenario's Assumptions:**
- More optimistic on technical tractability than Catastrophe

### Successful Coordination Examples

**Nuclear Weapons:**
- International cooperation despite Cold War tensions
- Non-proliferation regime partially successful
- No use in warfare since 1945
- Lessons: Common threat can enable coordination, verification crucial, imperfect but valuable

**Montreal Protocol:**
- Coordinated phase-out of ozone-depleting substances
- Industry initially opposed, then complied
- Alternatives developed, problem largely solved
- Lessons: Scientific consensus can drive policy, international cooperation possible

**Human Genome Project:**
- International collaboration on transformative technology
- Open sharing of data despite competitive pressure
- Ethical guidelines developed alongside research
- Lessons: Scientific community can coordinate, culture matters

### Failed Coordination Examples

**Climate Change:**
- Long delay between scientific consensus and action
- Free-rider problems dominate
- Short-term incentives override long-term thinking
- Lessons: Diffuse harms hard to coordinate on, political will difficult to maintain

**AI Development So Far:**
- Limited coordination on safety
- Racing dynamics in capability development
- Some safety work but not proportionate to risks
- Lessons: This is our baseline - improvement needed for Aligned AGI scenario

## Probability Assessment

### Scenario Probability Estimates

Expert estimates for the likelihood of achieving aligned AGI vary widely, reflecting fundamental uncertainties about both technical alignment tractability and coordination feasibility. The central question is whether humanity can solve multiple hard problems—technical, strategic, and political—before capabilities race ahead of safety measures.

**Implied probability of aligned AGI success:** If median P(doom) is 5-10%, and 10-20% of outcomes involve other negative scenarios (e.g., permanent lock-in, muddle through), then aligned AGI scenarios represent approximately 70-85% of remaining probability mass. However, this scenario's specific requirements (alignment solved AND coordination achieved AND beneficial deployment) narrow the estimate to 10-30%.

| Expert/Source | Estimate | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Baseline estimate | 10-30% | This scenario requires many things to go right both technically and strategically. Alignment must prove solvable, international cooperation must hold despite economic pressures, and we need sufficient time between warning signs and catastrophic capabilities. The range reflects deep uncertainty about whether technical breakthroughs will arrive in time and whether coordination mechanisms can resist racing dynamics. |
| Optimists | 30-50% | Alignment is fundamentally solvable given sufficient research effort, and humans have historically proven capable of coordination when existential stakes become clear. The Montreal Protocol and nuclear non-proliferation demonstrate that international cooperation on existential risks is possible. Economic incentives may favor coordination over racing if the benefits of safe AGI far exceed first-mover advantages. |
| Pessimists | 5-15% | Too many critical dependencies must simultaneously succeed: solving alignment, achieving US-China cooperation, maintaining corporate safety culture under profit pressure, getting a capability plateau for breathing room, and preventing any catastrophic failures that would break trust. Historical precedents like climate change show how difficult long-term coordination is even with clear scientific consensus. |
| Median view | 15-25% | This outcome is not impossible but requires significant luck alongside skilled execution. Some key uncertainties (like whether we get a capability plateau) are largely outside our control. However, concerted effort on alignment research and international coordination could meaningfully shift probabilities upward. The scenario represents our best-case outcome rather than our most likely path. |

### Why This Probability?

**Reasons for Optimism (Pushing Higher):**
- Alignment research making real progress
- Growing awareness of risks among leaders
- Economic incentives may favor coordination
- Humanity has solved hard coordination problems before
- AI could help us solve alignment for more powerful AI
- Warning signs might come early enough

**Reasons for Pessimism (Pushing Lower):**
- Many technical uncertainties remain
- Coordination is very difficult historically
- Economic pressures for racing are intense
- Geopolitical tensions are high
- Time might be too short
- No guarantee of capability plateau
- Deceptive alignment might be undetectable

**Central Estimate Rationale:**
10-30% reflects that this scenario requires many things to go right, but is not impossible. It's our best-case outcome, but not our most likely. The wide range reflects deep uncertainty about both technical tractability and coordination feasibility.

### What Would Change This Estimate?

**Evidence Increasing Probability:**
- Major alignment breakthroughs
- US-China AI safety cooperation advancing
- Capability growth slowing
- Public support for safety increasing
- Lab safety culture strengthening
- Successful coordination on other global challenges

**Evidence Decreasing Probability:**
- Alignment hitting fundamental roadblocks
- International tensions increasing
- Racing dynamics intensifying
- Safety incidents being ignored
- Political will for regulation weakening
- Successful deception by AI in evaluations

## Open Questions and Debates

**Technical Debates:**
- Is alignment fundamentally solvable or are there impossibility results?
- Will interpretability scale to superhuman systems?
- Can we detect deceptive alignment reliably?
- Is corrigibility compatible with high capability?

**Strategic Debates:**
- Can US-China cooperate on AI given geopolitical tensions?
- Will economic incentives favor coordination or racing?
- Can democratic institutions govern transformative AI?
- Is voluntary corporate self-regulation sufficient?

**Empirical Uncertainties:**
- How much time do we have before transformative AI?
- Will we get clear warning signs?
- How economically disruptive will AI be?
- What will public reaction to powerful AI be?

**Philosophical Questions:**
- What values should we align AI to?
- Who decides what "beneficial" means?
- How do we handle value disagreements?
- What role should humans play in an AI-assisted world?
