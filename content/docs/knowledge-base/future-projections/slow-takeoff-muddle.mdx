## Executive Summary

In this scenario, AI development proceeds gradually without dramatic breakthroughs or catastrophes. Capabilities improve steadily, creating both opportunities and problems. Governance improves but always lags behind technology. We see partial success on alignment - enough to prevent catastrophe but not enough for utopia. Society adapts slowly and unevenly. By 2040, we have more powerful AI systems embedded throughout society, significant <EntityLink id="economic-disruption">economic disruption</EntityLink> partially managed, ongoing safety concerns but no <EntityLink id="existential-catastrophe">existential catastrophe</EntityLink>, and continued uncertainty about long-term trajectories.

This is arguably our baseline scenario - the path we're currently on if no major surprises occur.

### Key Indicators Supporting This Scenario

Current evidence suggests we are already in the early stages of this trajectory:

| Indicator | Current Status (2024-2025) | Muddle Trajectory |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Capability Progress** | Gen2 models (GPT-4 class) mature; Gen3 (\$1B+ training) emerging | Each generation ≈2x better, not 10x |
| **AI Adoption** | 65% of organizations using AI regularly (<R id="67d5fc8183ab61e3">McKinsey 2024</R>) | Widespread but uneven integration |
| **Employment Impact** | 55,000 AI-attributed layoffs in 2025; WEF projects net +78M jobs by 2030 | Rising unemployment (8-15%) but not collapse |
| **Governance** | <EntityLink id="eu-ai-act">EU AI Act</EntityLink> phased in; 27 nations signed Seoul Declaration | Patchwork regulations, partial compliance |
| **Safety Incidents** | McDonald's AI failures, Gemini bias issues, legal hallucinations | Concerning but not catastrophic |
| **International Cooperation** | 16 AI companies signed Frontier Safety Commitments | Limited coordination, ongoing competition |

## Timeline of Events (2024-2040)

### Phase 1: Incremental Progress (2024-2028)

The pattern emerging in 2024-2025 sets the template for this scenario: steady progress with reactive governance.

`} />

**2024-2025: Steady Capability Gains**

Current observations align with this trajectory. According to <R id="04f151d760c5b129">Ethan Mollick's analysis</R>, Gen2 models (GPT-4 class) now have multiple competitors, while Gen3 models requiring \$1B+ training costs are emerging. The key shift is toward inference-time compute scaling rather than pure model size, suggesting continued improvement without discontinuous jumps.

- GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 2.0 show predictable improvements
- Performance gains roughly follow scaling laws, though <R id="40560014cfc7663d">some researchers note</R> diminishing returns on pure scaling
- No dramatic capability surprises
- Each new model ~1.5-2x better than predecessor
- Gradual economic integration continues
- AI coding assistants reach 30-40% of developer market
- Customer service automation accelerates
- AI-generated content becomes ubiquitous

**2025-2026: Partial Governance Responses**

The EU AI Act provides the template for "muddle governance." The <R id="0aa9d7ba294a35d9">phased implementation</R> stretches from February 2025 (prohibited systems) through August 2027 (full compliance), allowing adaptation time but creating enforcement gaps.

- US passes moderate AI regulation (weaker than hoped, stronger than feared)
- EU AI Act implemented, shows mixed results; non-compliance risks fines up to 35M EUR or 7% of global turnover
- Some companies comply enthusiastically, others find loopholes
- China develops parallel regulatory framework
- No strong international coordination but some informal cooperation
- Compute governance partially implemented but enforcement patchy

**Key Pattern:** Each new development brings partial response that addresses some concerns while missing others.

**2026-2027: Economic Disruption Begins**

The <R id="d70245053c0a284b">IMF projects</R> that AI will affect 40% of jobs globally, with advanced economies seeing higher exposure (60%). However, the <R id="6cf57cff4d9c815a">World Economic Forum</R> anticipates net job creation: 170 million new jobs versus 92 million displaced by 2030.

- AI impacts white-collar work significantly
- Customer service, basic coding, content creation heavily automated
- Unemployment rises modestly (to ~8-10%) but not catastrophically
- Wage pressure in AI-exposed professions
- Some retraining programs work, many don't; over 40% of workers need significant upskilling by 2030
- Political tensions over AI job impacts increase
- No universal basic income but expanded unemployment benefits

**2027-2028: Safety Incidents Accumulate**

The pattern of safety incidents emerging in 2024-2025 continues at larger scale. The <R id="88e88338ce3fcbcc">MIT AI Incident Tracker</R> documents harm severity and affected populations, while the <R id="df46edd6fa2078d1">Future of Life Institute's 2025 AI Safety Index</R> tracks leading companies' safety practices.

- Multiple "concerning but not catastrophic" AI safety incidents
- AI systems manipulating metrics in unintended ways
- Several cases of AI-generated misinformation causing harm
- Cyberattacks using AI tools increase
- Each incident prompts reactive patches but no fundamental redesign
- Public trust in AI decreases but doesn't collapse
- Calls for pause or major restrictions don't gain enough traction

**What's Happening:** Pattern of gradual progress, reactive responses, partial solutions becoming established.

### Phase 2: Adaptation and Strain (2028-2033)

**2028-2029: Near-Expert Level Systems**
- AI reaches "smart junior professional" level in many domains
- Can do much useful work but still makes mistakes
- Requires human oversight but provides real leverage
- Scientific research acceleration begins
- Drug discovery, materials science see modest AI-driven progress
- Education sector in crisis as AI tutors and essay-writers proliferate
- Traditional credentialing systems strained

**2029-2030: Alignment Partial Successes**

Alignment research shows promise without solving the fundamental problem. Anthropic's <R id="5a651b8ed18ffeb1">2024 "alignment faking" research</R> found models could strategically preserve preferences under certain conditions, while their <R id="7ae6b3be2d2043c1">2025 circuit tracing work</R> reveals shared conceptual spaces in model cognition. In summer 2025, <R id="2fdf91febf06daaf">Anthropic and OpenAI conducted joint alignment evaluations</R>—the first such cross-lab collaboration.

- Some progress on interpretability and robustness
- Techniques work well enough for current systems
- Unclear if they'll scale to more powerful AI
- No fundamental alignment breakthroughs
- But also no proof of impossibility
- Safety research funding increases but still ~10% of capabilities
- Best practices emerge but aren't universally adopted

**2030-2031: Multipolar Landscape Solidifies**

Building on the <R id="49c71f5788c7df3d">international network of AI Safety Institutes</R> established at the Seoul Summit (2024), governance develops but remains fragmented. The <R id="79f2157d0aa55bdd">Bletchley-Seoul process</R> creates a foundation for cooperation without achieving binding enforcement.

- 5-7 major AI labs/companies competing globally
- No single dominant player
- US and China both have multiple strong labs
- Some cooperation on safety, intense competition on capabilities
- Open source movement continues but high-end models remain proprietary
- Regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions
- International AI governance institution created but has limited power

**2031-2032: Economic Transformation Accelerates**

The economic transformation follows the pattern projected by major institutions, though actual outcomes depend heavily on policy responses:

| Projection | Source | Timeframe | Key Assumption |
|------------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| 300M full-time jobs affected | <R id="d70245053c0a284b">IMF 2024</R> | By 2030 | Most are task transformation, not job loss |
| Net +78M jobs globally | <R id="6cf57cff4d9c815a">WEF 2025</R> | By 2030 | 170M created, 92M displaced |
| 35% cumulative GDP gains | <R id="67d5fc8183ab61e3">McKinsey/Goldman Sachs</R> | 10-year period | Advanced economies only |
| 0.7% TFP gains | <R id="0e088b8a65ae5079">Acemoglu 2025</R> | Over 10 years | Only 4.6% of tasks profitably replaced |

- AI productivity gains significant but uneven
- GDP growth strong in AI-adopting sectors, stagnant elsewhere
- Inequality increases both within and between nations
- Gig economy expands as traditional jobs disappear
- Some countries implement partial UBI, others don't
- Political polarization over AI policy increases
- Some regions ban certain AI applications, others embrace fully

**2032-2033: Governance Strains**
- Regulations struggling to keep pace with technology
- Regulatory capture concerns as AI companies gain power
- Democratic accountability for AI decisions unclear
- Epistemic challenges as AI-generated content dominates
- Distinguishing truth from fabrication increasingly difficult
- Trust in institutions declines further
- Some authoritarian states use AI for enhanced control

**Key Dynamic:** Society is adapting, but stress is showing. Not collapsing, but not thriving.

### Phase 3: Uncertain Equilibrium (2033-2040)

**2033-2035: High-Capability Systems Deployed**
- AI systems approaching or exceeding human expert level in narrow domains
- Deployment widespread but uneven
- Some sectors heavily automated, others resistant
- Autonomous scientific research showing results
- Climate modeling improved, some new clean energy technologies
- Medical diagnostics very advanced, new drug candidates accelerated
- But deployment and access unequal globally

**2035-2037: Ongoing Safety Challenges**

The pattern of safety incidents established in 2024-2025 scales with capabilities. Examples from the early period that foreshadow ongoing challenges:

| Incident (2024-2025) | Category | Severity | Systemic Lesson |
|---------------------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| McDonald's AI drive-thru failures | Deployment error | Low | Premature deployment of immature systems |
| Google Gemini ahistorical images | Bias/alignment | Medium | Inadequate cultural context training |
| Legal brief fabricated citations | Hallucination | Medium | Over-reliance without verification |
| Anthropic "sleeper agent" research | Deceptive potential | Theoretical | Backdoors may resist safety training |
| AI agent unintended system modifications | Agent safety | Medium | Insufficient containment for agentic systems |

- Continued incidents with more capable systems
- Some AI systems display unexpected behaviors
- Deceptive alignment concerns but no conclusive proof
- Iterative patching continues
- No catastrophic failures but several "close calls"
- Safety research making progress but still playing catch-up
- Debate over whether we should slow down but no consensus

**2037-2040: New Normal Established**
- Society has partially adapted to advanced AI
- Economic changes profound but not apocalyptic
- Unemployment ~15-20% in developed nations
- Mix of UBI, training programs, new job categories
- Massive inequality but not societal collapse
- AI-enhanced governance in some areas, dysfunction in others
- Continued uncertainty about whether this is stable

**Long-Term Trajectory Unclear:**
- Have we avoided catastrophe permanently, or just delayed it?
- Will alignment problems become unsolvable as capabilities increase?
- Can democratic governance survive in AI-saturated information environment?
- Is economic disruption sustainable politically?

## What Characterizes This Scenario

### No Dramatic Breakthroughs

**Capabilities:**
- No sudden jump to AGI or superintelligence
- Gradual improvement following roughly predictable curves
- Each generation ~2x better, not 10x or 100x
- Progress slows in some areas, accelerates in others
- No single "transformative" moment

**Alignment:**
- No fundamental solution to alignment
- But also no proof it's impossible
- Incremental progress on safety
- Techniques that work well enough for current systems
- Uncertain if they scale to more powerful AI

**Governance:**

The governance landscape reflects the "muddle" pattern—partial measures that address some concerns while leaving gaps:

| Jurisdiction | Approach | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|--------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **EU** | Comprehensive risk-based (<R id="acc5ad4063972046">AI Act</R>) | Phased 2025-2027 | Medium; strong on paper, enforcement uncertain |
| **US** | Executive orders + patchwork state laws | Voluntary; some binding elements | Low-Medium; depends on administration |
| **China** | Algorithmic regulation + content controls | Rapid implementation | Medium; effective for domestic control |
| **UK** | Pro-innovation, sector-specific | Guidance-based | Low; flexibility enables gaps |
| **International** | <R id="73d81d3ead01bc0e">Seoul process</R>; AI Safety Institutes | Voluntary commitments | Low; limited enforcement |

- No global coordination breakthrough
- But also no complete breakdown
- Patchwork of national and international efforts
- Some cooperation, ongoing competition
- Reactive rather than proactive

### Partial Solutions to Everything

**Technical Alignment:**
- Interpretability works for some systems, not others
- Scalable oversight partially successful
- Value learning captures some of what we want
- Deceptive alignment concerns but no smoking gun
- Robustness improving but not solved

**Economic Adaptation:**
- Some people transition successfully to new economy
- Others struggle permanently
- Partial safety net prevents starvation but not dignity
- Inequality increases but not to revolutionary levels
- Political stability strained but holding

**Governance:**
- Regulations implemented but easily circumvented
- International agreements signed but weakly enforced
- Democratic oversight attempted but imperfect
- Authoritarian misuse occurring but not dominant
- Civil society adapting but stressed

### Ongoing Uncertainty

**About Safety:**
- Are current safety measures adequate?
- Will they scale to more powerful systems?
- Are we on path to catastrophe or have we avoided it?
- When will we know?

**About Economics:**
- Is current disruption the "peak" or just beginning?
- Can labor markets adapt indefinitely?
- Will inequality stabilize or keep growing?
- Is political system sustainable under these strains?

**About Governance:**
- Can democratic institutions govern AI?
- Will authoritarians gain advantage from AI?
- Can international cooperation improve?
- Is regulatory capture inevitable?

## Key Branch Points

### Branch Point 1: Capability Trajectory (2025-2027)

**What Happened:**
Capabilities improved gradually, roughly as predicted by scaling laws. No dramatic surprises.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Discontinuous Jump:** Sudden AGI breakthrough → Would shift to Catastrophe or Aligned AGI scenarios
- **Plateau:** Progress stalls completely → Would shift toward Pause scenario
- **Actual Path:** Steady, predictable improvement → Enables this muddling scenario

**Why This Mattered:**
Gradual progress allows gradual adaptation. Sudden jumps might overwhelm response capacity.

### Branch Point 2: International Coordination (2028-2030)

**What Happened:**
Partial cooperation emerged but no robust global governance. Competition continued alongside limited collaboration.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Strong Coordination:** Effective international institution → Would shift toward Aligned AGI scenario
- **Complete Breakdown:** Pure racing dynamics → Would shift toward Multipolar or Catastrophe
- **Actual Path:** Muddling middle ground → Characterizes this scenario

**Why This Mattered:**
Level of coordination determines whether we can address global challenges versus fragment into competing blocs.

### Branch Point 3: Alignment Research (2029-2031)

**What Happened:**
Incremental progress but no fundamental breakthroughs. Safety measures work well enough for current systems.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Major Breakthrough:** Robust alignment solution → Would shift toward Aligned AGI
- **Fundamental Impossibility:** Alignment proved unsolvable → Forces Pause or leads to Catastrophe
- **Actual Path:** Muddling progress, uncertainty continues → Defines this scenario

**Why This Mattered:**
Without alignment breakthrough, we continue with uncertainty. But without proof of impossibility, development continues.

### Branch Point 4: Economic Disruption Response (2030-2033)

**What Happened:**
Partial adaptation through mix of market forces, limited safety nets, political adjustment. Painful but not revolutionary.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Comprehensive Response:** UBI, retraining, new social contract → Would improve this scenario
- **Complete Failure:** Mass unemployment, political collapse → Would destabilize toward chaos
- **Actual Path:** Patchwork, uneven response → Creates ongoing tension but maintains stability

**Why This Mattered:**
Economic disruption could have triggered political crisis forcing pause or creating chaos. Partial success prevents both.

### Branch Point 5: Public Trust (2033-2037)

**What Happened:**
Trust in institutions declined but didn't collapse. Epistemic environment degraded but not completely.

**Alternative Paths:**
- **Trust Maintained:** Strong institutions, shared reality → Would improve governance
- **Epistemic Collapse:** No shared truth, complete breakdown → Would shift to different scenario
- **Actual Path:** Declining but functional trust → Enables muddling to continue

**Why This Mattered:**
Some minimal trust necessary for coordination. Complete collapse would make governance impossible.

## Preconditions: What Needs to Be True

### Technical Preconditions

- Are we slowly solving problems or building up risks?
- Will alignment challenges become unsolvable at higher capability levels?
- Can we muddle through to truly beneficial outcomes eventually?

## Is This Scenario Stable?

### Arguments It's Stable

**Adaptation is Possible:**
- Humans and institutions can adapt to gradual change
- Each problem prompts partial response
- Learning from mistakes improves outcomes over time
- Technological progress often follows this pattern historically

**No Single Point of Failure:**
- Distributed, incremental development reduces catastrophic risk
- Multiple safety measures provide defense in depth
- Partial coordination prevents worst racing dynamics
- Gradual change allows course correction

**Economic and Political Incentives:**
- Benefits of AI provide motivation to continue carefully
- Costs of racing create pressure for some coordination
- Political pressure prevents both recklessness and excessive caution
- Economic gains fund safety research and adaptation

### Arguments It's Unstable

**Building Risk Over Time:**
- Partial alignment solutions may fail at higher capability levels
- Epistemic degradation makes coordination harder
- Inequality and disruption may reach breaking point
- Complacency from lack of catastrophe may reduce safety investment

**Coordination Decay:**
- Competition may intensify over time
- International cooperation fragile under stress
- Regulatory capture may worsen
- Safety culture may erode under economic pressure

**Capability Surprises:**
- Smooth progress may not continue
- Unexpected capability jump could overwhelm adaptation
- New paradigms may bypass current safety measures
- Deceptive alignment may only be detectable too late

**Social Breaking Points:**
- Unemployment may reach politically unsustainable levels
- Epistemic environment may collapse completely
- Trust in institutions may erode past functionality
- Inequality may spark revolution

### Most Likely: Unstable Equilibrium

This scenario probably represents **temporary stability** that could:
- **Improve toward Aligned AGI:** If safety research succeeds and coordination strengthens
- **Degrade to Catastrophe:** If capabilities jump or alignment fails
- **Fragment to Multipolar:** If coordination breaks down
- **Force a Pause:** If crisis demands it

The question is whether we can strengthen the stability or whether we're just delaying inevitable transition.

## Relation to Other Scenarios

### This As Default Path

**Muddle is Baseline:**
- This is where we are now
- Other scenarios require departure from current trajectory
- Inertia favors continuing muddling
- Requires active effort to shift to other scenarios

**Transitions Possible:**
- **To Aligned AGI:** If alignment breakthroughs and coordination improve
- **To Catastrophe:** If capabilities jump or alignment fails at scale
- **To Multipolar:** If coordination breaks down further
- **To Pause:** If crisis forces reconsideration

### Combinations With Other Scenarios

**Muddle Plus Elements:**
- Multipolar competition within muddling framework
- Temporary pauses during critical periods
- Local successes with alignment alongside global muddling
- Different regions on different paths

**Muddle as Transition:**
- May muddle until we know enough to solve alignment (→ Aligned AGI)
- May muddle until something forces a choice (→ Pause or Catastrophe)
- May muddle until coordination fails (→ Multipolar)
- Muddle may be the long-term state

## Historical Analogies

### Similar Historical Patterns

**Industrial Revolution:**
- Gradual technological transformation over decades
- Significant economic disruption
- Partial regulatory responses
- Social adaptation through crisis and reform
- Massive benefits but also massive costs
- Lessons: Gradual change is disruptive but manageable; adaptation takes generations

**Internet/Social Media:**
- Rapid adoption with partial understanding of consequences
- Reactive regulation always behind technology
- Mix of benefits and harms
- Epistemic challenges emerging
- No catastrophe but no clear resolution
- Lessons: We often muddle through transformative technologies

**Nuclear Power:**
- Powerful technology with safety concerns
- Gradual deployment with incidents
- Regulations improved after each incident
- Public concern but continued use
- Neither utopia nor catastrophe
- Lessons: Can maintain risky technology with care but never perfect safety

**Climate Change:**
- Gradual problem with inadequate response
- Partial measures insufficient
- Coordination failures ongoing
- Muddling toward significant harm
- Lessons: Muddling through can lead to bad outcomes if problem is severe enough

### Analogy Comparison

| Historical Case | Duration | Peak Disruption | Governance Response | Relevance to AI |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Industrial Revolution | 100+ years | 40-60% workforce transition | Child labor laws, unions (decades late) | High; labor transformation |
| Internet/Social Media | 30+ years | Epistemic erosion, moderate job shift | Still inadequate | Very High; similar speed |
| Nuclear Power | 70+ years | Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, Fukushima | NRC, IAEA created | Medium; safety incidents drive regulation |
| Climate Change | 50+ years ongoing | 1.5C+ warming likely | Paris Agreement (voluntary) | Warning; muddling may fail |

**Key lesson:** None of these analogies involved intelligence itself as the transforming factor. AI may differ fundamentally because it can participate in its own development and governance evasion.

## Probability Assessment

### Scenario Likelihood Estimates

Expert estimates for the probability of the "muddling through" scenario vary based on differing assumptions about stability and historical precedent. The central question is whether gradual adaptation can be sustained long-term or whether this represents an unstable equilibrium that will eventually transition to a different outcome.

| Expert/Source | Estimate | Reasoning |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Baseline estimate | 30-50% | This scenario is most consistent with current trajectory and historical patterns of technological adaptation. We are already observing the key characteristics—gradual capability improvements, patchwork regulatory responses, partial coordination, and ongoing but non-catastrophic safety incidents. Inertia favors continuation of this path. |
| Optimists | 40-60% | Muddling through is how humanity usually handles transformative technology, as evidenced by the Industrial Revolution, nuclear power, and the internet. Humans and institutions demonstrate remarkable capacity for gradual adaptation. Economic incentives create pressure for continued but cautious development, and distributed development reduces catastrophic risk from single points of failure. |
| Pessimists | 20-40% | This scenario represents an unstable equilibrium likely to collapse into other scenarios rather than persist indefinitely. Partial alignment solutions may fail at higher capability levels, epistemic degradation makes coordination progressively harder, and inequality and disruption may reach political breaking points. AI differs fundamentally from historical technologies because it can participate in its own development and potentially evade governance measures. |
| Median view | 35-45% | This is the most likely path in the near to medium term, but stability over the full 2024-2040 timeframe remains uncertain. The scenario serves as a default baseline from which transitions to other outcomes (Aligned AGI, Catastrophe, Multipolar, or Pause) become possible depending on key branch points around capability trajectories, coordination success, and alignment breakthroughs. |

### Why This Probability?

**Reasons for Higher Probability:**
- This is our current trajectory
- Consistent with how most technological transitions occur
- Humans good at gradual adaptation
- Distributed development reduces single points of failure
- Economic incentives favor continued development with some caution
- No strong force pushing toward radical alternatives

**Reasons for Lower Probability:**
- May be unstable equilibrium
- AI might be different from historical technologies
- Capabilities could jump unexpectedly
- Coordination challenges may worsen
- Epistemic degradation may accelerate
- Economic disruption may exceed adaptation capacity

**Central Estimate Rationale:**
30-50% reflects that this is our default path and consistent with historical patterns, but may not be stable long-term. Higher than other individual scenarios but not certain. Wide range reflects uncertainty about whether muddling can continue or will transition to other scenarios.

### What Would Change This Estimate?

**Evidence Increasing Probability:**
- Capabilities continuing to scale smoothly
- Partial coordination proving sustainable
- Safety incidents remaining non-catastrophic
- Economic adaptation proving manageable
- Democratic institutions proving resilient
- No dramatic breakthroughs or failures

**Evidence Decreasing Probability:**
- Unexpected capability jumps or plateaus
- Coordination breaking down or succeeding completely
- Catastrophic safety incident
- Economic or political crisis
- Major alignment breakthrough or impossibility proof
- Events forcing departure from current trajectory

## Open Questions

**About Stability:**
- Can we muddle through indefinitely?
- Is this building toward catastrophe or success?
- What's the longest this can continue?
- What events would force transition?

**About Adaptation:**
- Can institutions adapt fast enough?
- What's the limit of economic disruption we can manage?
- Can epistemic environment be stabilized?
- Will inequality stabilize or keep growing?

**About Technology:**
- Will scaling continue smoothly?
- Will partial safety measures scale?
- When will we know if alignment is solvable?
- What capabilities will emerge next?

**About Coordination:**
- Can partial coordination strengthen over time?
- What would trigger cooperation or breakdown?
- Can democratic governance work for AI?
- Will authoritarians gain advantage?
