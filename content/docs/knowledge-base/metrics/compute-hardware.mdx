**Huawei Ascend AI Chips** (<R id="229a59145d800dc0">SemiAnalysis</R>, <R id="f965a0454f44fdc7">Bloomberg</R>):

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 (Projected) | 2026 (Projected) |
|--------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Dies produced** | 507k (mostly 910B) | 805k-1.5M | 1.2M+ (Q4 alone) |
| **Packaged chips shipped** | approximately 200k | 600-700k | approximately 600k (910C) |
| **Yield rate (910C)** | — | approximately 20-30% | Improving to 70% target |
| **Technology node** | SMIC 7nm (DUV) | SMIC N+2 | Continued DUV |

**Production Bottlenecks** (<R id="229a59145d800dc0">SemiAnalysis</R>):

1. **HBM (High-Bandwidth Memory)** - Critical constraint:
   - Huawei's stockpile: 11.7M HBM stacks (7M from Samsung pre-restrictions)
   - Stockpile depletion: Expected end of 2025
   - CXMT domestic production: approximately 2M stacks in 2026 (supports only 250-400k chips)

2. **Yield challenges** (<R id="eb2026b344d0343c">TrendForce</R>):
   - Ascend 910C yield: approximately 20-30% (on older stockpiled equipment)
   - Ascend 910B yield: approximately 50%
   - Low yields force production cuts and order delays
   - Without EUV, advanced packaging, and unrestricted HBM access, chips remain constrained

3. **TSMC die bank**:
   - Huawei received 2.9M+ Ascend dies from TSMC (pre-sanctions)
   - This stockpile enables 2024-2025 production
   - Without die bank, production would be much lower

### Future Plans

**Huawei Fab Buildout**:
- Dedicated AI chip facility: End of 2025
- Additional sites: 2 more in 2026
- WFE (wafer fab equipment) spending: \$7.3B (2024, up 27% YoY)
- Global ranking: 4th largest WFE customer (from zero in 2022)

**Production Ramp Timeline**:
- Q3 2024: Ascend 910B production ramp begins
- Q1 2025: Ascend 910C mass production starts (on SMIC N+2 process)
- 2025-2026: Continued ramp, constrained by HBM

### Performance Gap

**Huawei vs. Nvidia** (<R id="5143d09fd54dca75">Tom's Hardware analysis</R>):
- Huawei ecosystem scaling up but **lags significantly** on efficiency and performance
- Technology node: 7nm (Huawei/SMIC) vs. 4nm/3nm (Nvidia/TSMC)
- Memory bottleneck: Ascend chips cannot match NVIDIA's HBM subsystem
- Export controls successfully limiting China's access to cutting-edge AI chips
- Gap expected to persist due to continued US restrictions

**Data Quality**: Medium. Based on industry analysis, supply chain reports, and informed estimates.

## 12. Semiconductor Equipment Lead Times

### ASML Lithography Equipment

**Historical Peak Lead Times (2022)**:
During the chip shortage peak:
- **ArF immersion equipment**: 24 months
- **EUV equipment**: 18 months
- **I-line equipment**: 18 months
- **Industry average** (all equipment): 14 months (up from 3-6 months pre-shortage)

**Current State (2024-2025)**:
- Lead times have moderated from 2022 peak but remain "incredibly long"
- Foundries must plan capacity expansions well in advance
- Exact current lead times not publicly disclosed

**ASML Production Capacity Targets**:

| Equipment Type | 2025 Target | Medium-term Target |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **EUV 0.33 NA** | 90 systems/year | Maintained |
| **DUV (immersion + dry)** | 600 systems/year | Maintained |
| **EUV High-NA (0.55 NA)** | - | ≈20 systems/year |

**2024 Shipments** (Actual):
- Total lithography: 418 systems
- EUV: 44 systems
- DUV: 374 systems
- Metrology/inspection: 165 systems

**High-NA EUV Systems**:
- **Cost**: \$400M+ per system (vs. \$200M for low-NA)
- **First commercial deployment**: Intel TWINSCAN EXE:5200B
- **Status**: Transition from low-NA to high-NA beginning 2024-2025

### Market Concentration

**ASML Market Dominance**:
- Lithography equipment market share: **~94%** (2024)
- Remaining 6%: Canon and Nikon
- **Monopoly** on EUV lithography (only supplier globally)

### Geopolitical Constraints

**China Export Restrictions**:
- ASML expects China customer demand to **decline significantly** in 2026 vs. 2024-2025
- However, total 2026 net sales not expected to fall below 2025 levels (non-China growth compensates)

**China's EUV Development**:
- Reports of prototype EUV lithography machine development
- Target: AI chip output by 2028 using domestic EUV
- Status: Early prototype, far from production capability

**Lead Time Implications**:
- Long lead times favor incumbents with existing allocations
- New entrants (especially geopolitically restricted) face multi-year delays
- Supply constraints on advanced packaging (CoWoS) now more critical than lithography

**Data Quality**: Medium-High. Based on ASML reports and industry analysis.

## Key Uncertainties & Debate

### Algorithmic Progress Measurement
The actual contribution of algorithmic improvements vs. scale-dependent effects remains debated. Measured innovations account for less than 100x of the claimed 22,000x improvement, with the gap attributed to scaling effects that are harder to isolate.

### Inference Compute Growth
Whether inference will truly dominate by 2030 depends on:
- Rate of model deployment at scale
- Efficiency improvements in inference
- Whether training runs continue to grow exponentially

### China's Production Reality
Estimates of China's domestic chip production vary widely (200k to 1.5M dies) due to:
- Yield rate uncertainty
- HBM supply constraints
- Stockpile utilization vs. new production
- Lack of independent verification

### GPU Utilization
Major labs don't disclose actual utilization rates, training efficiency, or infrastructure bottlenecks. The 80/20 training/inference split is an industry estimate, not measured data.
