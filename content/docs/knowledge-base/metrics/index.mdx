## Overview

This section documents metrics and indicators that can be tracked to monitor AI safety progress and risk dynamics. Quantitative measurement helps move beyond intuition toward evidence-based assessment.

## Metric Categories

### <EntityLink id="capabilities">Capabilities</EntityLink>
Measures of AI system capabilities:
- Benchmark performance trends
- Capability emergence timing
- Task completion rates

### <EntityLink id="compute-hardware">Compute & Hardware</EntityLink>
Infrastructure indicators:
- Training compute trends
- Chip production and access
- Energy consumption

### <EntityLink id="safety-research">Safety Research</EntityLink>
Progress on alignment and safety:
- Publication rates and citations
- Researcher headcount
- Funding levels

### <EntityLink id="alignment-progress">Alignment Progress</EntityLink>
Technical alignment indicators:
- <EntityLink id="interpretability-coverage">Interpretability coverage</EntityLink>
- Evaluation robustness
- Safety case development

### <EntityLink id="lab-behavior">Lab Behavior</EntityLink>
How labs are operating:
- Pre-deployment testing time
- Safety team size ratios
- RSP adoption rates

### <EntityLink id="geopolitics">Governance</EntityLink>
Policy and institutional indicators:
- Regulatory progress
- <EntityLink id="international-coordination">International coordination</EntityLink>
- Standards development

### <EntityLink id="public-opinion">Public & Expert Opinion</EntityLink>
Perception and discourse:
- Public awareness surveys
- Expert probability estimates
- Media coverage trends

### <EntityLink id="economic-labor">Economic & Labor</EntityLink>
Socioeconomic impacts:
- Automation displacement rates
- AI investment levels
- Productivity changes

## Why Metrics Matter

Good metrics help:
- **Detect early warning signs** of increasing risk
- **Evaluate intervention effectiveness** over time
- **Enable accountability** for labs and governments
- **Ground debates in data** rather than speculation
