## Overview

This page tracks the **size, growth, and resource allocation** of the AI safety research field. Understanding these metrics helps assess whether safety research is keeping pace with capabilities development and identify critical capacity gaps. The analysis encompasses researcher headcount, funding flows, publication trends, and educational programs.

**Key finding**: Despite rapid growth, AI safety research remains severely under-resourced relative to capabilities development, with spending ratios estimated at 1:10,000 or worse. The field has tripled from ~400 to ~1,100 FTEs (2022-2025) but capabilities research is growing faster, creating a widening absolute gap. Current safety funding represents just 0.0004% of global GDP, while AI capabilities investment exceeds \$100 billion annually. This creates significant questions about whether AI safety research can develop adequate solutions before transformative AI capabilities emerge.

## Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence | Trend |
|-----------|------------|----------|--------|
| **Researcher Shortage** | Critical | 1:50-100 safety:capabilities ratio | Worsening |
| **Funding Gap** | Severe | 1:10,000 spending ratio | Stable disparity |
| **Experience Gap** | High | Median 2-5 years experience | Slowly improving |
| **Growth Rate Mismatch** | Concerning | 21% vs 30-40% annual growth | Gap widening |

### Full-Time Researcher Headcount (2025)

| Category | Count | Organizations | Growth Rate |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Technical AI Safety | ≈600 FTEs | 68 active orgs | 21% annually |
| AI Governance/Policy | ≈500 FTEs | Various | 30% annually |
| **Total Safety Research** | **≈1,100 FTEs** | **70+ orgs** | **25% annually** |

**Data source**: <R id="241ffc16c6786bd6">AI Safety Field Growth Analysis 2025</R> tracking organizations explicitly branded as "AI safety."

**Key limitations**: <R id="6c3ba43830cda3c5">80,000 Hours</R> estimates "several thousand people" work on major AI risks when including researchers at major labs and academia, suggesting significant undercounting of part-time and embedded safety researchers.

### Field Composition by Research Area

**Top technical research areas** by organization count:
1. Miscellaneous technical AI safety research
2. <EntityLink id="E186">LLM safety</EntityLink>
3. <EntityLink id="E174">Interpretability</EntityLink>
4. <EntityLink id="E439">Alignment research</EntityLink>

**Historical growth trajectory**:
- 2022: ~400 FTE researchers total
- 2023: ~650 FTE researchers  
- 2024: ~900 FTE researchers
- 2025: ~1,100 FTE researchers

This represents consistent 25%+ annual growth, but still lags behind estimated capabilities research expansion of 30-40% annually.

## Funding Analysis

### Annual Safety Research Funding (2024-2025)

| Funding Source | Amount | Focus Area | Reliability |
|----------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| [Coefficient Giving](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-progress-in-2024-and-plans-for-2025/) | ≈\$10M (2024); \$10M RFP (2025) | Technical safety (21 research areas), governance | High |
| <R id="9baa7f54db71864d">Long-Term Future Fund</R> | ≈\$1-10M annually | Individual grants, upskilling | Medium |
| Government Programs | ≈\$160M+ | UK AISI (£240M), US AISI (\$10M), Canada (\$10M) | Growing |
| Corporate Labs | Undisclosed | Internal safety teams | Unknown |
| **Total Estimated** | **\$150-400M** | **Global safety research** | **Medium confidence** |

**Coefficient Giving context**: Since 2017, Coefficient Giving (then Open Philanthropy) has donated ≈\$136 million to AI safety (~12% of their \$1.8B total grants). They acknowledged their 2024 spending rate was "too slow" and are "more aggressively expanding support for technical AI safety work." Their [2025 RFP](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/request-for-proposals-technical-ai-safety-research/) covers 21 research directions including adversarial testing, model transparency, and theoretical alignment.

### Government Safety Investment

| Country/Region | Program | Funding | Key Initiatives | Timeline |
|----------------|---------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| United Kingdom | [UK AI Security Institute](https://www.aisi.gov.uk/) | £240M total | £15M Alignment Project, £8.5M Systemic Safety Grants, £200K Challenge Fund | 2023+ |
| United States | <EntityLink id="E365">US AISI</EntityLink> (renamed CAISI 2025) | \$10M (chronically underfunded) | Model evaluation partnerships with Anthropic/OpenAI | 2024+ |
| Canada | Canada AISI | \$10M | Research coordination | 2024+ |
| European Union | AI Act implementation | €100M+ | Regulatory infrastructure | 2024+ |

**Note**: The UK-US AI Safety Institutes signed a landmark agreement in 2024 to jointly test advanced AI models, share research insights, and enable expert talent transfers. However, US funding remains substantially lower than UK investment—the [NIST budget](https://www.nist.gov/) that hosts AISI has faced congressional budget cuts rather than the expansion requested by the Biden administration.

### Capabilities vs Safety Spending

**Critical disparity metrics**:
- **10,000:1** ratio of capabilities to safety investment (<R id="9d9b64da39fc8be9">Stuart Russell, UC Berkeley</R>)
- Companies spend **more than \$100 billion** building AGI vs **≈\$10 million** philanthropic safety research annually
- AI safety funding: **0.0004% of global GDP** vs **\$131.5B** in AI startup VC funding (2024)
- Only **2% of AI publications** concern safety issues despite 312% growth in safety research (2018-2023)
- External safety organizations operate on budgets smaller than a frontier lab's daily burn

**Capability researcher growth comparison** ([AI Safety Field Growth Analysis 2025](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7YDyziQxkWxbGmF3u/ai-safety-field-growth-analysis-2025)):

| Metric | Safety Field | Capabilities Field | Gap |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| Annual growth rate | 21-24% | 30-40% | Widening |
| OpenAI headcount | N/A | 300 → 3,000 (2021-2025) | 10x growth |
| Anthropic, DeepMind | N/A | Each grown more than 3x | Rapid expansion |
| ML papers per year | ≈45,000 safety-related (2018-2023) | Doubles every 2 years | Exponential |

**For context**: Global philanthropic climate funding reaches **\$1-15 billion annually**, making climate funding 20-40x larger than AI safety funding. Prominent AI safety advocates recommend increasing safety investment to at least **30% of compute resources**, a level far above current allocations.

- External safety organizations continue operating on budgets smaller than frontier lab daily burn

---

## Key Uncertainties & Research Gaps

### Critical Unknowns

**Capability researcher count**: No comprehensive database exists for AI capabilities researchers. Estimates suggest 30,000-100,000 globally based on:
- <EntityLink id="E218">OpenAI</EntityLink> growth: 300→3,000 employees (2021-2025)
- Similar expansion at <EntityLink id="E22">Anthropic</EntityLink>, <EntityLink id="E98">DeepMind</EntityLink>
- ML conference attendance doubling every 2-3 years

**Industry safety spending**: Most AI labs don't disclose safety vs capabilities budget breakdowns. Known examples:
- IBM: 2.9%→4.6% of AI budgets (2022-2024)
- OpenAI: Super-alignment team disbanded (May 2024)
- Anthropic: Constitutional AI research ongoing but budget undisclosed

### Expert Disagreements
