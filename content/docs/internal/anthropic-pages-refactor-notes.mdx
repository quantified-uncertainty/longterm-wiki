# Anthropic Pages Refactor Notes

This document captures ideas for future improvements to the Anthropic page cluster.

## Current Structure (as of Feb 2026)

We implemented a **Hub-and-Spoke Model**:

| Page | Role | Canonical For |
|------|------|---------------|
| `anthropic.mdx` | **Hub** | Company overview, history, products, safety research |
| `anthropic-valuation.mdx` | Spoke | All valuation analysis (bull/bear, scenarios, multiples) |
| `anthropic-ipo.mdx` | Spoke | IPO timeline, preparation, prediction markets |
| `anthropic-investors.mdx` | Spoke | EA capital (pledges, matching, investor stakes) |
| `anthropic-impact.mdx` | Spoke | Net safety impact model |

Each spoke has a scope note at the top clarifying its purpose and linking to related pages.

## Option B: Data Module (Recommended for Future)

### Problem Solved
Key facts (revenue, valuation, customer concentration) appear in multiple pages. When data changes, you must update 3-4 places manually. This caused the "3.8x cheaper" error to persist.

### Solution
Create a YAML data file that pages import:

```yaml
# src/data/entities/anthropic-facts.yaml
financials:
  valuation: "$350B"
  valuation_date: "January 2026"
  revenue_arr: "$9B"
  revenue_date: "end 2025"
  revenue_2026_guidance: "$20-26B"
  gross_margin: "40%"
  breakeven_target: "2028"

competitors:
  openai_valuation: "$500B"
  openai_revenue: "$20B"
  openai_revenue_date: "January 2026"

risks:
  customer_concentration: "25%"
  top_customers: ["Cursor", "GitHub Copilot"]

enterprise:
  retention_rate: "88%"
  industry_avg_retention: "76%"
  business_customers: "300,000+"

talent:
  interpretability_team_size: "40-60"
  safety_researchers: "200-330"
  safety_pct_of_technical: "20-30%"
```

### Implementation

1. Create the YAML file
2. Create a React component `<AnthropicFact field="valuation" />` that reads from the data
3. Replace hardcoded figures in MDX with component calls
4. Add a build step that validates the YAML

### Benefits
- **Single source of truth**: Update once, propagates everywhere
- **Auto-staleness detection**: Could flag if `valuation_date` is >3 months old
- **Structured data**: Could power dashboards, comparisons

### Complexity
- Requires new component
- Build step changes
- Migration effort for existing pages

### Priority
**Medium-High**. Worth doing when we have time, especially as data changes frequently.

## Option C: Merge IPO into Valuation

### Problem Solved
`anthropic-ipo.mdx` and `anthropic-valuation.mdx` have significant overlap—both discuss financial trajectory, valuation scenarios, and market context.

### Solution
Merge into a single `anthropic-financial-analysis.mdx` page with sections:
1. Current Valuation Context
2. Bull/Bear Cases
3. IPO Timeline and Preparation
4. Valuation Scenarios
5. Implications

### Benefits
- One fewer page to maintain
- No redundancy between IPO and valuation content
- Clearer scope: "everything financial about Anthropic"

### Downsides
- Longer page (would be ~6000 words)
- IPO content might become stale faster than valuation content
- Loses granularity in linking (can't link specifically to "IPO timeline")

### Priority
**Low**. Current hub-and-spoke model with scope notes is working. Merge only if maintaining two pages becomes burdensome.

## Other Ideas for Future

### 1. Timeline Visualization
Create a visual timeline of Anthropic's funding rounds, valuation progression, and key events. Could use Mermaid or a custom component.

### 2. Comparison Page
Create `anthropic-vs-openai.mdx` that directly compares the two across dimensions: safety, commercial, talent, governance. Currently this info is scattered.

### 3. Automated Data Freshness
Add frontmatter field `dataAsOf: "2026-01-15"` and surface warnings when data is >90 days old.

### 4. Cross-Wiki Consistency
Ensure OpenAI page uses same metrics/timeframes as Anthropic pages for fair comparison.
