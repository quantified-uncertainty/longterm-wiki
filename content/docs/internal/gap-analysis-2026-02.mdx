# Wiki Gap Analysis — February 2026

Systematic review of coverage gaps across the wiki's 639 pages, combining `crux gaps list` output (existing pages needing insight extraction) with manual topic coverage analysis to identify both under-developed existing pages and entirely missing topics.

## Executive Summary

The wiki has **strong structural coverage** (639 pages across 25 categories) but significant gaps in three areas:

1. **Insight extraction**: 386 pages (of 519 tracked) lack insights. 203 high-importance pages have zero insights.
2. **Fast-moving topics**: Chinese AI labs, test-time compute, frontier model transparency, and recent incidents are under-represented.
3. **Category imbalances**: Incidents (2 pages), forecasting (2 pages), and capabilities (11 pages) are notably thin relative to their importance.

| Dimension | Coverage | Key Gap |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Policy & governance | ~70% | Implementation tracking, enforcement status |
| Safety techniques | ~55% | Post-2024 methods, effectiveness evidence |
| Frontier evaluations | ~40% | Specific benchmarks, scaling analysis |
| AI labs & orgs | ~65% | Chinese labs, emerging players |
| Capabilities | ~45% | Vision/multimodal, inference-time compute |
| Incidents | ~5% | Only 2 incident pages despite many documented cases |
| Open-source safety | ~15% | Downstream risks, audit methods |
| International governance | ~40% | Deep coordination, compliance tracking |

## Part 1: Missing or Under-Covered Pages

A prioritized list of 100 missing pages is maintained in the [Suggested Pages dashboard](/internal/suggested-pages), ranked by numeric priority (1–100) based on how often each topic is mentioned across existing pages and editorial importance to AI safety coverage.

The top 10 gaps by priority:

| Priority | Topic | Mentions | Status |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| 100 | AI Governance | 183 | Sub-topics exist, no umbrella page |
| 99 | Reinforcement Learning | 81 | No standalone page |
| 98 | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) | 404 | No page |
| 97 | GPT-4 | 193 | No page |
| 96 | Claude (Model Family) | 186 | No page |
| 95 | Frontier Model (Concept) | 161 | No definition page |
| 94 | Training Data | 111 | No page |
| 93 | Safety Evaluations | 106 | No page |
| 92 | Misalignment Potential | 110 | 110 EntityLinks, no page |
| 91 | Civilizational Competence | 104 | 104 EntityLinks, no page |

## Part 2: Existing High-Priority Pages Needing Insight Extraction

From `crux gaps list`, the top 20 existing pages with highest gap scores (importance × quality, zero insights):

| Rank | Score | Imp | Qual | Page | Category |
|------|-------|-----|------|------|----------|
| 1 | 166 | 87 | 91 | Intervention Portfolio | responses |
| 2 | 162 | 85 | 91 | Scheming & Deception Detection | responses |
| 3 | 159 | 85 | 87 | OpenAI Foundation | organizations |
| 4 | 157 | 82 | 91 | Capability Elicitation | responses |
| 5 | 157 | 82 | 91 | AI Safety Cases | responses |
| 6 | 157 | 82 | 91 | Bioweapons | risks |
| 7 | 157 | 82 | 91 | Multipolar Trap | risks |
| 8 | 151 | 87 | 73 | Intervention Effectiveness Matrix | models |
| 9 | 151 | 90 | 68 | Evaluation Awareness | responses |
| 10 | 151 | 79 | 91 | Reward Hacking | risks |
| 11 | 151 | 85 | 78 | Sleeper Agents: Training Deceptive LLMs | risks |
| 12 | 149 | 85 | 75 | AI Control | responses |
| 13 | 149 | 90 | 65 | Eval Saturation & The Evals Gap | responses |
| 14 | 149 | 78 | 91 | Pause Advocacy | responses |
| 15 | 149 | 78 | 91 | Sandboxing / Containment | responses |
| 16 | 149 | 78 | 91 | Structured Access / API-Only | responses |
| 17 | 149 | 78 | 91 | Compute Thresholds | responses |
| 18 | 149 | 78 | 91 | Tool-Use Restrictions | responses |
| 19 | 149 | 78 | 91 | Voluntary Industry Commitments | responses |
| 20 | 149 | 85 | 75 | Deceptive Alignment | risks |

### Recommended batch for insight extraction:
Run `crux insights extract` on these pages to populate the insights data layer. The responses category is most under-extracted (4/136 pages = 3% coverage).

## Part 3: Category-Level Coverage Statistics

From `crux gaps stats`:

| Category | Pages | With Insights | Coverage | Priority |
|----------|-------|---------------|----------|----------|
| responses | 136 | 4 | 3% | **CRITICAL** |
| organizations | 106 | 0 | 0% | **CRITICAL** |
| models | 78 | 0 | 0% | **HIGH** |
| risks | 60 | 0 | 0% | **HIGH** |
| people | 40 | 0 | 0% | Medium |
| intelligence-paradigms | 16 | 0 | 0% | Medium |
| capabilities | 11 | 10 | 91% | Low (well covered) |
| debates | 11 | 3 | 27% | Medium |
| metrics | 10 | 8 | 80% | Low (well covered) |
| cruxes | 5 | 5 | 100% | Done |
| future-projections | 5 | 4 | 80% | Low |
| incidents | 2 | 0 | 0% | **HIGH** (few pages) |
| forecasting | 2 | 2 | 100% | Done (but few pages) |

**Key finding**: 93% of pages (482/519) have zero insights. The insight extraction pipeline should prioritize the responses (136 pages) and organizations (106 pages) categories.

## Part 4: Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate actions (next sessions)

1. **Create top-priority pages** (priority 90+) via `crux content create` — see [Suggested Pages](/internal/suggested-pages)
2. **Expand adversarial-robustness stub** via `crux content improve`
3. **Run insight extraction** on top-20 gap-scored pages

### Short-term actions

1. **Create priority 70–89 pages**: DeepSeek, Hallucination, Multimodal AI, Jailbreaking, etc.
2. **Run insight extraction** on all 0-insight pages with importance \>= 80 (203 pages)

### Medium-term actions

1. **Work through priority 40–69 pages** from the [Suggested Pages](/internal/suggested-pages) dashboard
2. **Systematic insight extraction** across remaining categories
