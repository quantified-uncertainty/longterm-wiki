# Page Type System

LongtermWiki uses a two-level classification system to categorize content:

1. **Page Type** (`pageType`): Controls validation behavior and quality scoring eligibility
2. **Page Template** (`pageTemplate`): Determines expected structure and applicable style guide

Understanding this distinction is critical: a page can have `pageType: content` (meaning it receives full validation) while also having `pageTemplate: knowledge-base-risk` (meaning it should follow risk page structure).

---

## Page Types Overview

| Type | Set By | Quality Scored? | Validated? | Count |
|------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| `content` | Default | Yes | Full | ≈450 |
| `stub` | Explicit frontmatter | No | Minimal | ≈10 |
| `documentation` | Explicit frontmatter | No | No | ≈10 |
| `overview` | Auto (index.mdx) | No | Navigation only | ≈50 |

---

## `content` (Default)

### What It Is

The default page type for all substantive knowledge base content. If you don't specify a `pageType` in frontmatter, the page is treated as `content`. This is the workhorse type covering risks, responses, models, organizations, people, and all analytical content.

### When to Use

- **All knowledge base pages** that should be graded, improved, and maintained
- Any page where quality matters and should be tracked
- Pages that will appear in improvement queues and quality reports
- You don't need to explicitly set `pageType: content` - it's the default

### Validation Behavior

Content pages receive **full validation**:

- **Quality grading**: Must go through `grade-content.mjs` to get a quality score (0-100)
- **Structural checks**: Tables, citations, diagrams are counted and affect quality
- **Style guide compliance**: Must follow the relevant template's style guide
- **Staleness warnings**: Old `lastEdited` dates trigger alerts
- **EntityLink validation**: All referenced entities must exist
- **MDX compilation**: Syntax errors fail CI
- **Dollar sign escaping**: Unescaped `$` causes failures

### Quality Scoring

Content pages are scored on four dimensions by `grade-content.mjs`:

| Dimension | Scale | What It Measures |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| **Novelty** | 0-10 | Originality beyond summarizing sources |
| **Rigor** | 0-10 | Evidence quality, citations, quantification |
| **Actionability** | 0-10 | Usefulness for decisions |
| **Completeness** | 0-10 | Coverage of the topic |

These combine into an overall **quality score (0-100)** plus automated **metrics** (wordCount, citations, tables, diagrams).

**Important**: Quality must ONLY be set by `grade-content.mjs`, never manually or by LLM self-assessment. The `quality-source` validation rule enforces this by checking that pages with `quality` also have `ratings`.

### Relevant Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Brief description for search and previews"
# pageType: content  # Optional - this is the default
pageTemplate: knowledge-base-risk  # Which structure to follow
quality: 45  # Set ONLY by grade-content.mjs
importance: 60  # How significant for AI safety prioritization
lastEdited: "2026-01-31"
llmSummary: "One-sentence summary with key conclusions"
ratings:
  novelty: 4
  rigor: 5
  actionability: 3
  completeness: 5
metrics:
  wordCount: 1500
  citations: 8
  tables: 2

todos:
  - "Add more quantitative estimates"
  - "Include counterarguments section"
---
```

### Examples

- `/knowledge-base/risks/deceptive-alignment.mdx`
- `/knowledge-base/responses/interpretability.mdx`
- `/knowledge-base/organizations/anthropic.mdx`
- `/knowledge-base/models/takeover-scenarios.mdx`

---

## `stub`

### What It Is

A **stub** is an intentionally minimal page that exists primarily for navigation or reference purposes. Stubs are explicitly marked and excluded from quality scoring because their brevity is by design, not a deficiency.

### When to Use

1. **Redirect pages**: When content has moved or been consolidated elsewhere
   - Use `seeAlso` field to point to the primary page
   - Example: Open Philanthropy → Coefficient Giving after rebrand

2. **Brief profiles**: People or organizations that don't warrant full pages
   - Just enough info to be useful in search/browse
   - Links to external resources

3. **Deprecated concepts**: Topics kept for link stability
   - Old terminology that redirects to current naming
   - Historical pages that shouldn't be deleted but aren't maintained

4. **Intentional placeholders**: Topics planned for future expansion
   - Better than a 404, but marked as incomplete by design

### Validation Behavior

Stub pages are **excluded from most validation**:

- ❌ Not graded by `grade-content.mjs`
- ❌ Not checked by style guide validators
- ❌ Not included in improvement queues
- ❌ Not counted in quality reports
- ✅ Still validated for MDX compilation
- ✅ Still validated for EntityLink references
- ✅ Still validated for dollar sign escaping

### Relevant Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
title: "Open Philanthropy"
description: "Redirects to Coefficient Giving"
pageType: stub
seeAlso: "coefficient-giving"  # Points to the primary page
sidebar:
  order: 10
lastEdited: "2026-01-29"
---
```

The `seeAlso` field is particularly important for stubs - it tells readers (and automated tools) where the real content lives.

### Content Expectations

A stub should contain:

1. **Brief explanation** of what this page is about (1-3 sentences)
2. **Clear pointer** to where comprehensive coverage exists (EntityLink)
3. **Backlinks component** to show what references this page
4. Optionally: minimal quick facts if genuinely useful

A stub should NOT contain:

- Detailed analysis or substantial content
- Multiple sections with headers
- Tables, diagrams, or extensive formatting
- Content that duplicates the primary page

### Example

```mdx
---
title: "Open Philanthropy"
description: "Redirects to Coefficient Giving after November 2025 rebrand"
pageType: stub
seeAlso: "coefficient-giving"
---
import {Backlinks, EntityLink} from '@components/wiki';

**Open Philanthropy rebranded to <EntityLink id="coefficient-giving" /> in November 2025.**

For comprehensive information about AI safety funding, grants, and the 2025 Technical AI Safety RFP, see the Coefficient Giving page.

<Backlinks />
```

---

## `documentation`

### What It Is

Documentation pages contain **internal reference material** about LongtermWiki itself - style guides, process documentation, code examples, and meta-content. They are excluded from content validation because they may contain intentional examples of "bad" formatting, placeholder text, or code snippets.

### When to Use

1. **Style guides**: Documentation of how to write different page types
   - `/internal/risk-style-guide/`
   - `/internal/response-style-guide/`

2. **Process documentation**: How LongtermWiki systems work
   - This page (`/internal/page-types/`)
   - Rating system documentation

3. **Internal planning**: Strategy documents, project notes
   - `/project/similar-projects/`
   - `/project/strategy-brainstorm/`

4. **Technical reference**: Code examples, API documentation
   - Content database documentation
   - Script usage guides

### Validation Behavior

Documentation pages are **excluded from all content validation**:

- ❌ Not graded by `grade-content.mjs`
- ❌ Not checked by style guide validators
- ❌ Not checked for content quality issues
- ❌ Not included in any improvement queues
- ✅ Still validated for MDX compilation (must render)
- ✅ Basic frontmatter schema validation

This exclusion is important because documentation pages often contain:

- Example code with intentional placeholders
- Demonstrations of what NOT to do
- Reference tables that don't follow content patterns
- Technical details irrelevant to content quality

### Relevant Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
title: "Risk Style Guide"
description: "How to write risk analysis pages for LongtermWiki"
pageType: documentation
sidebar:
  order: 3
---
```

Documentation pages typically have minimal frontmatter - no quality, importance, ratings, or metrics since they're not graded.

### Content Expectations

Documentation pages should be:

- **Clear and actionable** for their intended audience (usually contributors)
- **Well-organized** with logical structure
- **Up-to-date** when processes change
- **Self-contained** or linking to relevant external resources

Unlike content pages, documentation can freely include:

- Code blocks and technical examples
- Placeholder text for illustration
- Checklists and process steps
- Screenshots and interface mockups

### Examples

- `/internal/page-types.mdx` (this page)
- `/internal/risk-style-guide.mdx`
- `/internal/rating-system.mdx`
- `/project/similar-projects.mdx`

---

## `overview` (Auto-detected)

### What It Is

Overview pages are **automatically detected** from the filename `index.mdx`. They serve as navigation hubs for sections of the site, providing an entry point and links to child pages. You never set `pageType: overview` in frontmatter - it's inferred.

### When to Use

Any `index.mdx` file is automatically treated as an overview page. These exist at:

- Section roots: `/knowledge-base/risks/index.mdx`
- Category roots: `/knowledge-base/organizations/index.mdx`
- Topic clusters: `/knowledge-base/responses/index.mdx`

### Validation Behavior

Overview pages receive **limited validation**:

- ❌ Not graded by `grade-content.mjs`
- ❌ Not included in quality reports
- ✅ Sidebar structure validation (must be properly configured)
- ✅ Link integrity checking
- ✅ MDX compilation

### Content Expectations

Overview pages should provide:

1. **Brief introduction** to the section (1-2 paragraphs)
2. **Navigation structure** - links to key child pages
3. **Organizational logic** - why pages are grouped this way
4. Optionally: summary tables, key takeaways across the section

Overview pages should NOT:

- Duplicate substantial content from child pages
- Require extensive maintenance as children change
- Include detailed analysis (that belongs in child pages)

### Example

```mdx
---
title: "AI Risks"
description: "Analysis of risks from advanced AI systems"
---

This section covers the landscape of risks from AI development and deployment.

## Categories

- **Accident Risks**: Unintended harmful behaviors from AI systems
- **Misuse Risks**: Deliberate harmful applications of AI
- **Structural Risks**: Systemic issues from AI development dynamics

## Key Pages

- [Deceptive Alignment](/knowledge-base/risks/deceptive-alignment/)
- [Power Concentration](/knowledge-base/risks/power-concentration/)
```

---

## Page Templates

While `pageType` controls validation behavior, `pageTemplate` controls the **expected structure** and which style guide applies. A page can be `pageType: content` (fully validated) with different templates.

### Available Templates

| Template | Used For | Style Guide |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `knowledge-base-risk` | Risk analysis pages | `/internal/risk-style-guide/` |
| `knowledge-base-response` | Intervention/response pages | `/internal/response-style-guide/` |
| `knowledge-base-model` | Analytical models | `/internal/models-style-guide/` |
| `ai-transition-model-factor` | ATM top-level factors | `/internal/ai-transition-model-style-guide/` |
| `ai-transition-model-sub-item` | ATM sub-factors | `/internal/ai-transition-model-style-guide/` |
| `ai-transition-model-scenario` | ATM scenarios | `/internal/ai-transition-model-style-guide/` |

### Template Detection

Templates can be:

1. **Explicitly set** in frontmatter: `pageTemplate: knowledge-base-risk`
2. **Inferred from URL** for some paths (e.g., `/knowledge-base/risks/**`)

### Example with Both Fields

```yaml
---
title: "Deceptive Alignment"
description: "Risk of AI systems appearing aligned during training but pursuing different goals"
pageType: content  # Optional - default
pageTemplate: knowledge-base-risk  # Required structure
quality: 67
importance: 85
---
```

---

## Interaction with Quality Pipeline

### What Gets Graded

| Page Type | Graded by `grade-content.mjs`? | In improvement queues? |
|-----------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| `content` | Yes | Yes |
| `stub` | No | No |
| `documentation` | No | No |
| `overview` | No | No |

### The `quality-source` Validation Rule

To enforce that quality ratings come from the grading script (not manual entry or LLM self-assessment), the `quality-source` rule checks:

- If a page has `quality` set
- But does NOT have `ratings` (novelty, rigor, etc.)
- Then it was set outside the proper pipeline → **warning**

This catches pages where someone manually typed `quality: 75` or an LLM suggested a quality score during content generation.

### Fixing Pages with Manual Quality

If you see: `Quality (X) set without ratings - use 'npm run regrade -- page-id'`

Run:
```bash
npm run regrade -- page-id
```

This will use Claude to properly grade the page and set both `quality` and `ratings`.

## Quick Reference

### Setting Page Type

```yaml
# Content page (default - can omit)
pageType: content

# Stub page
pageType: stub
seeAlso: "primary-page-id"

# Documentation page
pageType: documentation
```

### Checking Page Types

```bash
# Count pages by type
grep -r "pageType:" src/content/docs/ | cut -d: -f3 | sort | uniq -c

# Find pages without explicit type (default to content)
find src/content/docs -name "*.mdx" -not -name "index.mdx" | \
  xargs grep -L "pageType:" | wc -l

# List all stubs
grep -l "pageType: stub" src/content/docs/**/*.mdx
```

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Run all validation
npm run validate

# Run quality-source check specifically
npm run crux -- validate unified --rules=quality-source

# Grade a specific page
npm run regrade -- page-id

# Grade all ungraded pages
node scripts/content/grade-content.mjs --skip-graded --apply
```

---

## Adding a New Page Type

If you need a new page type (rare), follow these steps:

1. **Update schema** in `src/content.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   pageType: z.enum(['content', 'stub', 'documentation', 'new-type']).optional()
   ```

2. **Update validation rules** in `scripts/lib/rules/quality-source.mjs` and other rules that check `pageType`

3. **Update PageStatus component** in `src/components/wiki/PageStatus.tsx`

4. **Create style guide** at `/internal/new-type-style-guide/`

5. **Update this documentation**

Most new content needs should be handled by adding a new `pageTemplate`, not a new `pageType`. Only add a page type if you need fundamentally different validation behavior.
