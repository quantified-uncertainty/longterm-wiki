## Purpose

The canonical facts system lets us store key numbers (valuations, revenue, headcounts) in YAML and reference them across wiki pages. When a number changes, we update one YAML file and every page that references it stays correct.

Two MDX components power this:
- **`<F>`** — display a single fact inline (with hover tooltip showing metadata)
- **`<Calc>`** — compute a derived value from 2+ facts (e.g. revenue multiples, growth rates)

## Quick Reference

```jsx
{/* Simple fact display */}
<F e="anthropic" f="valuation">$380B</F>

{/* Fact with auto-rendered value (no children needed) */}
<F e="anthropic" f="valuation" />

{/* Fact with inline date — renders "300,000+ (as of 2025)" */}
<F e="anthropic" f="business-customers" showDate />

{/* Computed value from two facts */}
<Calc expr="{anthropic.valuation} / {anthropic.revenue-run-rate}" precision={0} suffix="x" />

{/* Growth percentage */}
<Calc expr="({anthropic.revenue-mid-2025} / {anthropic.revenue-early-2025} - 1) * 100" precision={0} suffix="%" />
```

## Which Numbers Should Be Facts?

Not every number in the wiki should be a fact. The key question is: **will this number change when new data arrives?**

### Must be facts (Tier 1)

Numbers that **change over time** AND **appear on 2+ pages**.

| Example | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Anthropic's valuation | Updated every funding round, referenced on IPO, valuation, and company pages |
| OpenAI's revenue | Changes quarterly, appears on multiple comparison pages |
| Total AI safety funding | Updated annually, appears on funding and field overview pages |

These are the highest-ROI facts. Updating one YAML entry keeps N pages correct.

### Should be facts (Tier 2)

Numbers that **change over time** but currently appear on only 1 page.

| Example | Why |
|---------|-----|
| "300,000+ business customers" | Will be 400,000+ within months |
| Prediction market probabilities | Change daily |
| Net cash burn rates | Updated quarterly |

Even on one page, wrapping these in `<F>` means the update workflow is "edit YAML" not "search through prose."

### Should NOT be facts (Tier 3)

**Fixed historical numbers** that will never change.

| Example | Why |
|---------|-----|
| "Founded in 2021" | Historical fact, won't update |
| "Series A raised \$124M in May 2021" | Fixed in time |
| "Hired Wilson Sonsini in December 2025" | One-time event |

Making these into facts adds overhead with no benefit.

### Decision flowchart

1. Will this number change when new data comes in? **No** → plain text
2. Does it appear on 2+ pages? **Yes** → must be a fact (Tier 1)
3. Appears on 1 page but will change? **Yes** → should be a fact (Tier 2)

## When to Use `<F>` vs `<Calc>`

### Use `<F>` for single fact display

Any time you're showing a stored number — a valuation, revenue figure, headcount, date — use `<F>`.

```jsx
{/* With explicit display text */}
<F e="anthropic" f="valuation">\$380 billion</F>

{/* Auto-display from the fact's value field */}
<F e="anthropic" f="valuation" />

{/* With inline date for temporal claims */}
Over <F e="anthropic" f="business-customers" showDate /> business customers
{/* Renders: "Over 300,000+ (as of 2025) business customers" */}
```

**`showDate`** is important for sentences where the recency of a number is part of the claim. When the fact gets updated (e.g. to 400,000+ / 2026-06), the prose automatically reads the new number and date without anyone needing to edit the surrounding text.

### Use `<Calc>` for derived computations

When you need a value that's **computed from 2+ facts** — ratios, multiples, growth percentages — use `<Calc>`.

```jsx
{/* Revenue multiple */}
<Calc expr="{anthropic.valuation} / {anthropic.revenue-run-rate}" precision={0} suffix="x" />

{/* Growth rate */}
<Calc expr="({anthropic.revenue-mid-2025} / {anthropic.revenue-early-2025} - 1) * 100" precision={0} suffix="%" />

{/* Comparison */}
<Calc expr="{openai.valuation-2025} / {anthropic.valuation}" precision={1} suffix="x" />
```

The power: when **either** input fact updates, the derived number auto-updates too. A revenue multiple stays correct whether the valuation or revenue changes.

### Do NOT use `<Calc>` for single values

If you're just displaying one fact with no computation, use `<F>`, not `<Calc>`. `<Calc>` is for math, `<F>` is for display.

```jsx
{/* Wrong — no computation happening */}
<Calc expr="{anthropic.valuation}" format="currency" />

{/* Right — just display the fact */}
<F e="anthropic" f="valuation" />
```

### Use plain text for everything else

Historical numbers, qualitative descriptions, and one-off figures that won't change don't need either component.

## YAML Fact Structure

Facts live in `data/facts/<entity>.yaml`:

```yaml
entity: anthropic
facts:
  valuation:
    value: "$380 billion"        # Human-readable display string
    numeric: 380000000000        # Raw number (required for Calc)
    asOf: "2026-02"              # When this was current
    note: "Series G post-money"  # Context shown in tooltip
    source: "https://..."        # Attribution URL
```

**Required fields:**
- `value` — display string (used by `<F>` when no children are provided)
- `numeric` — raw number (required if used in any `<Calc>` expression)
- `asOf` — temporal anchor (strongly recommended for any changing number)

**Optional fields:**
- `note` — shown in tooltip
- `source` — attribution link
- `noCompute: true` — skip build-time computation (for non-numeric values like "2028")
- `compute` — formula for build-time derived facts
- `format` / `formatDivisor` — display formatting hints

## Updating Facts

When new data arrives:

1. Edit the YAML file in `data/facts/<entity>.yaml`
2. Update `value`, `numeric`, and `asOf`
3. Run `node app/scripts/build-data.mjs` to rebuild
4. Every `<F>` and `<Calc>` referencing that fact auto-updates

**Keep old point-in-time facts as separate entries** when pages reference them explicitly:

```yaml
# Current valuation (gets updated)
valuation:
  value: "$380 billion"
  numeric: 380000000000
  asOf: "2026-02"

# Historical snapshot (stays fixed, referenced by comparison sections)
valuation-nov-2025:
  value: "$350 billion"
  numeric: 350000000000
  asOf: "2025-11"
```

## Scaling Strategy

Current state: 4 entity YAML files, ~5 pages using facts. Priority order for expansion:

**Phase 1 — Organizations with fast-changing financials**
Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, Google DeepMind, Meta AI. These have valuations, revenue, headcounts that change quarterly. Highest density of volatile numbers.

**Phase 2 — Field-level metrics**
Compute benchmarks, total AI safety funding, researcher headcounts. Numbers that get updated with each new report and appear across multiple pages.

**Phase 3 — Cross-referenced numbers**
Any figure appearing on 3+ pages. Find these via grep and migrate to facts for consistency.

Don't try to fact-ify everything at once. Expand entity-by-entity as pages get created or updated.

## Common Patterns

### Valuation with context

```jsx
valued at <F e="anthropic" f="valuation" /> in its latest funding round
```

### Temporal metric in prose

```jsx
Over <F e="anthropic" f="business-customers" showDate /> business customers
{/* → "Over 300,000+ (as of 2025) business customers" */}
```

### Revenue multiple in a table

```jsx
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Revenue Multiple** | <Calc expr="{anthropic.valuation} / {anthropic.revenue-run-rate}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> |
```

### Growth rate comparison

```jsx
revenue grew <Calc expr="({anthropic.revenue-mid-2025} / {anthropic.revenue-early-2025} - 1) * 100" precision={0} suffix="%" /> in seven months
```

### Side-by-side company comparison

```jsx
Anthropic trades at ≈<Calc expr="{anthropic.valuation} / {anthropic.revenue-run-rate}" precision={0} suffix="x" /> revenue
vs OpenAI's ≈<Calc expr="{openai.valuation-2025} / {openai.revenue-arr-2025}" precision={0} suffix="x" />
```
