# Response Pages Style Guide

Response pages describe interventions, policies, and technical approaches that address AI risks. They explain how something works and assess its effectiveness.

**Prerequisite**: All response pages must follow the [Common Writing Principles](/internal/common-writing-principles/) — epistemic honesty, language neutrality, and analytical tone. The **objectivity** rating dimension measures this.

## Page Type Detection

Response pages are at: `/knowledge-base/responses/**/*.mdx`

## Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Response Name"
description: "One sentence explaining what this response does and its key mechanism."
quality: 60  # 0-100
importance: 70  # 0-100

```

## Required Sections

### 1. Overview (2-3 paragraphs)

What is this response and why does it matter?

### 2. Quick Assessment Table

```markdown
## Quick Assessment

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Tractability | Medium | Requires significant research investment |
| Scalability | High | Applies to most foundation models |
| Current Maturity | Low | Early research stage |
| Time Horizon | 5-10 years | Needs fundamental advances |
| Key Proponents | Anthropic, DeepMind | Active research programs |
```

### 3. How It Works

Technical explanation with diagram:

```markdown
## How It Works

<Mermaid chart={`
flowchart LR
    A[Input] --> B[Safety Layer]
    B --> C{Check}
    C -->|Pass| D[Output]
    C -->|Fail| E[Block/Modify]
`} />

[Detailed explanation of mechanism]
```

### 4. Risks Addressed

```markdown
## Risks Addressed

| Risk | Relevance | How It Helps |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| [Deceptive Alignment](/...) | High | Detects hidden goals |
| [Reward Hacking](/...) | Medium | Identifies misspecified rewards |
```

### 5. Limitations

What this approach cannot do or gets wrong.

### 6. Current State

Who is working on this, what progress has been made.

### 7. Open Questions

Unsolved problems and research directions.

## Claude Code Workflows

### Creating a New Response Page

```
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  prompt: `Create a response page for [RESPONSE_NAME].

  FIRST: Read /internal/response-style-guide/.

  THEN: Research using WebSearch:
  - Academic papers on the technique
  - Lab blog posts and announcements
  - Current implementations and results

  Create at: src/content/docs/knowledge-base/responses/[category]/[name].mdx

  Include:
  1. Overview (2-3 paragraphs)
  2. Quick Assessment table
  3. How It Works (with diagram)
  4. Risks Addressed table
  5. Limitations
  6. Current State
  7. Open Questions`
})
```

### Improving a Response Page

```
Task({
  subagent_type: 'general-purpose',
  prompt: `Improve response page at [PATH].

  Read /internal/response-style-guide/ first.

  Add:
  1. Quick Assessment table (if missing)
  2. Mermaid diagram
  3. Risks Addressed cross-links
  4. Citations from recent papers

  Use WebSearch for current research.`
})
```

## Quality Criteria

Pages are scored on seven dimensions (0-10 scale). **Scoring is harsh** - a 7 is exceptional, most content should score 3-5.

| Dimension | 3-4 (Adequate) | 5-6 (Good) | 7+ (Exceptional) |
|-----------|----------------|------------|------------------|
| **Novelty** | Accurate summary | Some original framing | Significant original insight |
| **Rigor** | Mixed sourcing | Mostly sourced | Fully sourced with quantification |
| **Objectivity** | Some insider language or false certainty | Mostly neutral, some uncertainty noted | Fully accessible, all estimates hedged |
| **Actionability** | Abstract implications | Some actionable takeaways | Concrete decision guidance |
| **Completeness** | Notable gaps | Covers main points | Thorough coverage |

**Derived quality (0-100)** combines subscores with word count and citation bonuses. See CLAUDE.md for formula.
