## Concept

The core idea: **risk compounds over time**, with different pathways contributing differently at different phases.

The AI Transition Model identifies:

**Catastrophe Pathways:**
1. AI Takeover (Rapid) - Fast recursive self-improvement leading to misaligned superintelligence
2. AI Takeover (Gradual) - Slow erosion of human control
3. Human Catastrophe (State Actor) - Great power conflict enabled by AI
4. Human Catastrophe (Rogue Actor) - Non-state actors using AI for mass harm

**Lock-in Types:**
1. Economic - Irreversible wealth/power concentration
2. Political - Authoritarian control solidified by AI
3. Epistemic - Information environment permanently degraded
4. Values - Human values shaped/locked by AI systems
5. Suffering - Persistent negative states (e.g., digital minds)

**Root Factors** (driving both outcomes):
- Misalignment Potential
- Misuse Potential
- AI Capabilities
- AI Ownership concentration
- Civilizational Competence
- Transition Turbulence

## Design Notes

**Timeline phases:**
- Current (2025-2030): Pre-TAI baseline
- Near-TAI (2031-2036): Approaching transformative AI
- TAI (2037-2044): Transformative AI arrival
- Post-TAI (2045+): Stabilization or continued turbulence

**Color encoding:**
- Warm colors (red/orange) = Catastrophe pathways
- Cool colors (blue/purple/pink) = Lock-in types
- Factor-specific colors for attribution

**Key features:**
- TAI marker line showing expected transition point
- Hover interactions for detailed values
- Toggle between pathway and factor views
- Confidence bands on trajectory lines

**What these visualizations convey:**
1. Risk accumulates non-linearly, with TAI as an inflection point
2. Different pathways dominate at different times
3. Lock-in may be the larger long-term concern even if catastrophe is avoided
4. Root factors have differential impact on different outcomes
