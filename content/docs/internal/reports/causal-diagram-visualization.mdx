## Tools Survey

### DAGitty - Browser-Based Causal Diagram Editor

**URL**: [dagitty.net](https://www.dagitty.net/)

DAGitty is a browser-based tool for creating, editing, and analyzing causal diagrams. Originally developed for epidemiology and statistics.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Graphical editor** | Click to add nodes, drag to connect |
| **Testable implications** | Auto-generates statistical independence assertions |
| **Adjustment sets** | Identifies confounders for causal inference |
| **Export** | SVG, PNG, LaTeX/TikZ |

<Aside type="tip" title="Relevance to Our Work">
DAGitty focuses on *statistical* causality (d-separation, backdoor criterion) rather than systems thinking. Our diagrams are more about conceptual causal chains than statistical adjustment.
</Aside>

**Example DAGitty diagram:**

### Vensim - System Dynamics Modeling

**URL**: [vensim.com](https://vensim.com/)

Vensim is the industry standard for system dynamics modeling, supporting both causal loop diagrams (CLDs) and stock-flow models.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Causal Tracing®** | Click any variable to see full causal chain |
| **Feedback loops** | First-class support for reinforcing/balancing loops |
| **Simulation** | Run models forward in time |
| **Large models** | Handles 1000+ variable models |
| **SyntheSim** | Real-time simulation during editing |

<Aside type="note" title="DAG vs CLD">
Our current implementation uses Dagre (DAG layout) which doesn't support cycles. Vensim's strength is handling feedback loops, which are common in real systems but create layout challenges.
</Aside>

**Key insight**: Vensim's Causal Tracing® feature (highlighting upstream/downstream paths) directly inspired our path highlighting implementation.

## Best Practices for Large Causal Graphs

### Progressive Disclosure

| Level | Node Count | Features |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Overview** | 5-10 | High-level categories only |
| **Expanded** | 20-50 | Subcategories visible |
| **Detailed** | 50-200 | All individual factors |
| **Full** | 200+ | Complete model (rarely needed) |

Our implementation uses four levels: Overview → Interactive → Expanded → Detailed.

### Semantic Zoom

As users zoom in, progressively reveal more information:

| Zoom Level | Shows |
|------------|-------|
| **Far** | Node shapes only, no labels |
| **Medium** | Labels appear |
| **Close** | Descriptions appear |
| **Very close** | Full metadata, inline charts |

<Aside type="tip" title="Implementation Note">
ReactFlow supports custom zoom-dependent rendering. We could hide descriptions at low zoom and show them at high zoom.
</Aside>

### Focus+Context

When a user selects a node:

1. **Highlight** the selected node and its causal path
2. **Dim** (but don't hide) unrelated nodes
3. **Thicken** edges in the causal chain
4. **Show** edge labels on highlighted paths only

Our path highlighting implementation follows this pattern.

### Handling Scale

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Clustering** | Group related nodes into expandable clusters |
| **Fisheye distortion** | Magnify focus area while compressing periphery |
| **Mini-map** | Always-visible overview for navigation |
| **Search/filter** | Let users find specific nodes |
| **LOD rendering** | Reduce detail at low zoom |

---

## Comparison: Our Implementation vs. Best Practices

| Best Practice | Our Status | Notes |
|---------------|------------|-------|
| Progressive disclosure | ✅ Implemented | 4 view levels |
| Expand/collapse clusters | ✅ Implemented | Interactive view |
| Path highlighting | ✅ Implemented | Click to highlight |
| Mini-map | ✅ Implemented | Expanded/Detailed views |
| Edge labels on hover | ✅ Implemented | Shows effect direction |
| Semantic zoom | ⚠️ Partial | Could add zoom-dependent detail |
| Feedback loops | ❌ Not supported | Dagre requires DAG |
| Temporal animation | ❌ Not implemented | Could show evolution |
| Search/filter | ❌ Not implemented | Would help at scale |
| Fisheye distortion | ❌ Not implemented | May not be needed |

## Potential Enhancements

Based on this research, potential future improvements:

### High Priority

1. **Semantic zoom** - Show/hide descriptions based on zoom level
2. **Node search** - Filter or highlight nodes matching a query
3. **Export to SVG/PNG** - For presentations and reports

### Medium Priority

4. **Loop annotation** - Mark known feedback loops in description even if not rendered
5. **Time-based views** - Show how causal relationships evolved
6. **Comparison view** - Side-by-side different model versions

### Lower Priority

7. **Fisheye lens** - Magnify focus area (complex UX)
8. **3D layout** - For very large graphs (accessibility concerns)
9. **Playable simulation** - Loopy-style "what if" exploration

### DAGitty Interface

The DAGitty editor showing a causal diagram with exposure (E), outcome (D), and confounders. Note the automatic identification of adjustment sets and testable implications on the right panel.

![DAGitty editor interface](/images/internal/dagitty-interface.png)

**Key features visible:**
- Variable type indicators (exposure, outcome, ancestor)
- Causal path highlighting (green line from E to D)
- Statistical independence implications
- Model code export

---

### Loopy Interface

Loopy uses a simple sketch-based interface where users draw nodes (circles) and connections (arrows). The key innovation is that diagrams are "playable" - drag a node up/down to see effects propagate through the system.

![Loopy causal loop interface](/images/internal/loopy-interface.png)

**Key features:**
- Direct manipulation (drag nodes)
- Polarity indicators (+/-) on edges
- Real-time simulation
- Zero learning curve

---

### Vensim Causal Tracing

Vensim's Causal Tracing® feature allows clicking any variable to highlight its entire causal ancestry. This directly inspired our path highlighting implementation.

**Key insight:** The ability to trace "what affects this variable" is crucial for understanding complex models. Our implementation uses BFS to find all upstream and downstream nodes.

*Note: Vensim is desktop software - visit [vensim.com](https://vensim.com/) to download the free PLE version.*
