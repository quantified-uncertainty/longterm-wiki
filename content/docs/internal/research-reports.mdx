## Purpose

Research reports are **deep-dive investigations** into specific topics within the knowledge base. They serve two primary functions:

1. **Comprehensive analysis** of a topic with citations from authoritative sources
2. **Input for diagram creation** - reports inform the causal models in cause-effect diagrams

Reports are generated with AI assistance (Claude Code) using web research and synthesis of existing content.

**Note:** The research-reports section has been deprecated. Research content now lives in the relevant knowledge-base sections (risks/, responses/, etc.).

## Formatting Guidelines

<Aside type="caution" title="Key Formatting Rules">
Follow the [Knowledge Base Style Guide](/wiki/E763) for general principles. These additional rules are specific to research reports.
</Aside>

### Use Tables Over Bullet Lists

**Bad (low density):**
```markdown
**Factor Name**
- Direction: Increases → topic
- Type: leaf
- Evidence: Some evidence
- Confidence: high
```

**Good (table format):**
```markdown
| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Factor Name** | ↑ Topic | leaf | Some evidence | High |
```

### Use Callouts/Asides Liberally

Add `<Aside>` components to highlight key insights, caveats, and implications. Aim for **at least 3-4 callouts per report**.

```mdx
<Aside type="tip" title="Why This Matters">
Key insight about safety implications.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitation">
Important caveat about the data.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Data Source">
Methodological note about how data was collected.
</Aside>
```

### Escape Dollar Signs

Currency values MUST be escaped to avoid LaTeX rendering:

| Wrong | Right | Renders As |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `$100,000` | `\$100,000` | \$100,000 |
| `$5B` | `\$5B` | \$5B |

Also escape in frontmatter description:
```yaml
description: "H-1B fees increased to \\$100K"
```

### Use Horizontal Rules

Separate major sections with `---` for visual clarity.

---

## Report Structure

Every research report should follow this structure:

```yaml
---
title: "Topic Name: Research Report"
description: "One-sentence summary with specific data (escape \\$ signs)."
topic: "entity-id"           # Links to knowledge-base or transition-model item
createdAt: 2025-01-07        # Date without quotes (YAML date type)
lastUpdated: 2025-01-07      # Date without quotes (YAML date type)
researchDepth: "standard"    # quick | standard | comprehensive
sources: ["web", "codebase"] # What sources were consulted
quality: 3                   # 1-5 quality rating
---
```

### Required Sections

| Section | Purpose | Format |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Executive Summary** | Key findings with data | **Table** (not bullets) |
| **Background** | Context and why this matters | Prose + Aside |
| **Key Findings** | Main research results | Prose + tables + Asides |
| **Causal Factors** | Factors for diagram creation | **Tables by strength** |
| **Open Questions** | Key uncertainties | **Table** |
| **Sources** | Organized citations | Lists by type |

---

## Section Templates

### Executive Summary (Table Format)

Use a table, not bullets:

```markdown
## Executive Summary

| Finding | Key Data | Implication |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **US dominance** | 57% of top researchers | US remains primary hub |
| **Policy risk** | \$100K H-1B fee | May accelerate brain drain |
| **Key uncertainty** | Immigration policy | Critical inflection point |
```

### Causal Factors (Table Format)

<Aside type="tip" title="Critical for Diagrams">
This section directly feeds into cause-effect diagram creation. Use tables to ensure factors map cleanly to diagram nodes and edges.
</Aside>

```markdown
## Causal Factors

### Primary Factors (Strong Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Immigration Policy** | ↑↓ Concentration | leaf | 80% retention depends on visas | High |
| **Research Ecosystem** | ↑ Concentration | cause | 60% of top institutions in US | High |

### Secondary Factors (Medium Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Graduate Programs** | ↑ Concentration | cause | 80% of students stay | Medium |

### Minor Factors (Weak Influence)

| Factor | Direction | Type | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|-----------|------|----------|------------|
| **Nationalist Sentiment** | ↓ Mobility | leaf | Limited evidence | Low |
```

**Column definitions:**
- **Factor**: Short name (2-5 words)
- **Direction**: ↑ (increases), ↓ (decreases), ↑↓ (bidirectional), Mixed
- **Type**: `leaf` (external), `cause` (derived), `intermediate` (direct factor)
- **Evidence**: Brief summary with source reference
- **Confidence**: High, Medium, or Low

### Open Questions (Table Format)

```markdown
## Open Questions

<Aside type="note" title="Key Uncertainties">
These questions represent the highest-value areas for follow-up research.
</Aside>

| Question | Why It Matters | Current State |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Will H-1B fees persist?** | \$100K changes economics | May face legal challenge |
| **Is China's surge sustainable?** | 47% share may be temporary | Depends on retention |
```

## Research Methodology

### Source Hierarchy

| Priority | Source Type | Examples | Trust Level |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Peer-reviewed research** | Nature, Science, arXiv | High |
| 2 | **Expert organizations** | RAND, Brookings, FHI, CAIS | High |
| 3 | **Government reports** | GAO, UK AISI, NIST | High |
| 4 | **Quality journalism** | Reuters, AP, major newspapers | Medium |
| 5 | **Industry analysis** | McKinsey, Gartner, OECD | Medium |
| 6 | **Blog posts/forums** | LessWrong, EA Forum | Variable |
| 7 | **Company announcements** | OpenAI, Anthropic blogs | Medium (verify) |

### Research Depth Levels

| Level | Time | Sources | Use When |
|-------|------|---------|----------|
| `quick` | 15-30 min | 5-10 | Initial exploration |
| `standard` | 1-2 hours | 15-25 | Most topics |
| `comprehensive` | 3-5 hours | 30-50+ | Critical topics |

---

## Validation Checklist

Before marking a report complete, verify:

| Check | Why | How to Fix |
|-------|-----|------------|
| **Dollar signs escaped** | Prevents LaTeX rendering | Replace `$` with `\$` |
| **Dates unquoted** | YAML schema requires date type | `createdAt: 2025-01-07` not `"2025-01-07"` |
| **Tables used** | Causal factors must be in tables | Convert bullet lists to tables |
| **Asides included** | Highlight key insights | Add 3-4 callouts minimum |
| **Sources organized** | Easier to assess quality | Group by type |
| **Links valid** | Broken links hurt credibility | Test all URLs |

**Run validators:**
```bash
npm run crux -- validate compile
npm run crux -- validate unified --rules=dollar-signs
```

---

## Quality Criteria

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1** | Basic outline, fewer than 10 sources, major gaps |
| **2** | Main points covered, 10-15 sources, some gaps |
| **3** | Solid coverage, 15-25 sources, minor gaps |
| **4** | Comprehensive, 25-35 sources, well-structured |
| **5** | Authoritative, 35+ sources, original synthesis |

---

## Integration with Diagrams

After a report is complete, the Causal Factors section can be directly converted to a causeEffectGraph:

| Report Column | Maps to Diagram |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Factor | Node label |
| Type | Node type (`leaf`, `cause`, `intermediate`) |
| Direction (↑/↓) | Edge effect (`increases`, `decreases`) |
| Strength (section) | Edge strength (`strong`, `medium`, `weak`) |
| Confidence | Edge confidence |

**Workflow:**
1. Create report → Research and document findings
2. Extract factors → Format in tables
3. Create diagram → Use `cause-effect-diagram` skill
4. Link both → Report references diagram

---

## File Location & Naming

**Note:** The research-reports directory has been removed. Research content should now be integrated into the appropriate knowledge-base sections (risks/, responses/, etc.).

**Naming:** Use kebab-case matching the topic entity ID:
- `ai-talent-concentration.mdx`
- `algorithmic-progress.mdx`
- `compute-governance.mdx`

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Bullet lists for factors | Low density, hard to scan | Use tables |
| Unescaped `$` | Renders as LaTeX | Use `\$` |
| Quoted dates | Schema validation fails | Remove quotes |
| No Asides | Misses key insights | Add 3-4 callouts |
| Flat hierarchy | Hard to navigate | Use h2/h3 structure |
| Missing validation | Errors in production | Run `npm run validate` |
