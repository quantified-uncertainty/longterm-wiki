These experiments visualize the **Critical Insight** framework—showing where we have knowledge versus the vast space of potential insights we haven't yet discovered.

## Concept

The core idea: **most of the "insight space" is unexplored**.

If we imagine all possible questions × topics × granularities as a huge grid, we've only filled in a tiny fraction. These visualizations make that visible:

1. **Sparse Grid**: Each cell is a potential insight area. Filled cells (bright) = we have something. Empty (dark) = unknown.

2. **Treemap**: Hierarchical view where the filled portion of each rectangle shows knowledge density. Most areas are mostly empty.

3. **Score Matrix**: Individual insights rated on Surprising × Important × Compact.

4. **Pixel Map**: Ultra-dense view showing thousands of potential insight areas, with ~2% explored.

## Individual Components

### Sparse Knowledge Grid

A 40×60 grid with ~4% fill rate:

<SparseKnowledgeGrid client:load rows={40} cols={60} fillProbability={0.04} cellSize={10} />

---

### Knowledge Treemap

Nested rectangles showing knowledge density by domain:

<KnowledgeTreemap client:load width={700} height={400} />

---

### Insight Score Matrix

Individual insights rated on the three criteria:

<InsightScoreMatrix client:load />

---

### Pixel Density Map

High-resolution view of the insight space:

<PixelDensityMap client:load width={200} height={200} pixelSize={3} />

---

### Research Frontier

3D-style columns showing exploration depth by research area:

<ResearchFrontier client:load width={650} height={400} />

---

### Priority Matrix (ITN Framework)

Classic Importance × Tractability × Neglectedness visualization:

<PriorityMatrix client:load />

---

### Topic × Question Grid

Categorical grid showing which question types we've addressed for each topic:

<TopicQuestionGrid client:load />

## Design Notes

**Color encoding:**
- Brightness = importance (brighter = more important)
- Saturation/hue = surprising (warmer = more surprising)
- Opacity = quality/confidence

**Interactivity:**
- Hover to see details
- Toggle color modes
- Sort by different criteria

**The key insight these visualizations convey:**
We've barely scratched the surface of what's knowable. Most cells are dark. This should motivate:
1. Systematic exploration of the space
2. Prioritizing high-importance regions
3. Seeking surprising findings (they carry more information)
