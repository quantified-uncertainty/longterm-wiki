## Quick Reference

Cause-effect diagrams are defined in YAML under the `causeEffectGraph` property of entities:

```yaml
- id: tmc-compute
  type: ai-transition-model-subitem
  title: Compute
  causeEffectGraph:
    title: "What Drives Effective AI Compute?"
    description: "Causal factors affecting frontier AI training compute."
    primaryNodeId: effective-compute
    nodes:
      - id: effective-compute
        label: Effective Compute
        type: effect
        description: Net compute available for AI training.
    edges:
      - source: chip-supply
        target: effective-compute
        strength: strong
        effect: increases
```

## Node Types

Nodes are organized into four hierarchical types that flow from root causes to effects:

| Type | Purpose | Color | Shape |
|------|---------|-------|-------|
| `leaf` | Root inputs, external factors | Teal/cyan | Rounded rectangle |
| `cause` | Derived factors from leaves | Light gray | Slightly rounded |
| `intermediate` | Direct contributing factors | Darker gray | Less rounded |
| `effect` | Target outcome(s) | Amber/yellow | Sharp corners |

<Aside type="tip" title="Visual Hierarchy">
The color gradient (teal → gray → amber) creates a visual flow from inputs to outputs. Shapes also encode function: rounder = more fundamental, sharper = final outcomes.
</Aside>

### Node Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique identifier (kebab-case) |
| `label` | Yes | Display text (2-5 words) |
| `type` | Yes | One of: `leaf`, `cause`, `intermediate`, `effect` |
| `description` | No | Brief explanation (shown on hover) |
| `confidence` | No | 0-1 confidence in this node's relevance |
| `color` | No | Semantic color name (see [Semantic Colors](#semantic-colors)) |
| `scores` | No | Rating dimensions (see [Node Scores](#node-scores)) |

## Edge Properties

Edges represent causal relationships between nodes:

| Property | Values | Visual Effect |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| `strength` | `weak`, `medium`, `strong` | Line thickness (1.2px, 2px, 3px) |
| `confidence` | `low`, `medium`, `high` | Line style (dashed, semi-dashed, solid) |
| `effect` | `increases`, `decreases`, `mixed` | Arrow color (blue, red, gray) |

<Aside type="note" title="Edge Direction">
Edges flow from cause to effect. The `source` node influences the `target` node.
</Aside>

### Edge Weight Guidelines

| Strength | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| `strong` | Direct, well-established causal link |
| `medium` | Meaningful but indirect influence |
| `weak` | Minor or speculative connection |

## Semantic Colors

Nodes can be assigned semantic colors to convey meaning at a glance. Use colors sparingly—about half of nodes should remain grey/neutral to make colored nodes stand out.

### Available Colors

| Color | Use For | Example Nodes |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `rose` | Risk factors, concerning inputs | "Actor Intent", "AI Biology Knowledge" |
| `red` | Major threat domains, severe risks | "Biological Threat", "Cyber Threat" |
| `emerald` | Defensive factors, countermeasures | "Biosecurity Defenses", "Export Controls" |
| `green` | Positive interventions | Alternative to emerald |
| `violet` | Key uncertainties, critical questions | "Does offense or defense win?" |
| `purple` | Alternative uncertainty color | Similar to violet |
| `teal` | Power centers, key actors | "Company Ownership", "Country Control" |
| `blue` | Structural/policy factors | "Cloud Partnerships", "Corporate Structures" |
| `amber` | Warnings, caution | (Effect nodes use amber by default) |
| `slate` | Neutral, less critical nodes | Technical details, well-known factors |
| `gray` | Alternative neutral | Similar to slate |

<Aside type="tip" title="Color Guidelines">
- **Color ~50%** of nodes; leave the rest grey/slate
- Reserve colors for **most critical** nodes (high sensitivity, novelty, or importance)
- Use `slate` for well-known factors (low novelty) or less decisive nodes
- Intermediates that just aggregate other nodes often work well as slate
</Aside>

### Example

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: key-threat
    label: Major Threat
    type: intermediate
    color: red
    description: Critical danger node
  - id: countermeasure
    label: Defense System
    type: leaf
    color: emerald
    description: Mitigating factor
  - id: technical-detail
    label: Implementation Detail
    type: leaf
    color: slate
    description: Less critical, well-known
```

## Node Scores

Nodes can have four scoring dimensions (1-10 scale) that enable interactive visualization modes in the diagram viewer.

### Score Dimensions

| Dimension | Scale | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `novelty` | 1-10 | How surprising to an informed reader (1=common knowledge, 10=very surprising) |
| `sensitivity` | 1-10 | How much downstream nodes change if this changes (1=minimal impact, 10=huge cascading effects) |
| `changeability` | 1-10 | How tractable/malleable is this factor (1=fixed/immutable, 10=highly changeable) |
| `certainty` | 1-10 | How well understood (1=deep uncertainty, 10=well established) |

<Aside type="note" title="View Modes">
When viewing a diagram with scores, use the view mode buttons to highlight nodes by score dimension. Higher-scoring nodes appear more prominent; lower-scoring nodes fade out.
</Aside>

### Example

```yaml
nodes:
  - id: ai-biology-knowledge
    label: AI Biology Knowledge
    type: leaf
    description: LLM knowledge of virology and synthesis routes.
    scores:
      novelty: 5        # Discussed but details less known
      sensitivity: 8    # Key enabler for bio-threat path
      changeability: 3  # Hard to roll back model knowledge
      certainty: 5      # Some benchmarks but real-world uplift uncertain
    color: rose
```

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Novelty | Sensitivity | Changeability | Certainty |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1-3 | Common knowledge | Minimal downstream impact | Fixed/immutable | Deep uncertainty |
| 4-6 | Somewhat familiar | Moderate impact | Somewhat malleable | Mixed evidence |
| 7-10 | Surprising insight | Huge cascading effects | Highly tractable | Well established |

## Layout Best Practices

### Node Count Limits

| Guideline | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Maximum nodes** | 15-20 (beyond this, split into multiple diagrams) |
| **Maximum edges** | 30-40 (avoid spaghetti) |
| **Nodes per layer** | 4-5 max horizontal nodes per type |

### Layer Organization

Organize nodes by their causal position:

```
Layer 1: leaf nodes (root causes, external factors)
    ↓
Layer 2: cause nodes (derived from leaves)
    ↓
Layer 3: intermediate nodes (direct factors)
    ↓
Layer 4: effect nodes (target outcomes)
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Avoid Feedback Loops">
The diagram renderer uses Dagre (DAG layout). Cycles create messy diagonal lines. If your model has feedback loops, note them in the description but omit them from the edges.
</Aside>

## When to Use Each Diagram Type

| Use Case | Diagram Type |
|----------|--------------|
| **Causal model** with 5-20 factors | CauseEffectGraph |
| **Simple flow** (3-5 steps) | Mermaid flowchart |
| **Taxonomy/hierarchy** | Table or Mermaid |
| **Proportions** | Mermaid pie chart |
| **2x2 matrix** | Mermaid quadrant |
| **Timeline** | Mermaid timeline |

<Aside type="tip" title="Choose CauseEffectGraph When">
- You're modeling causal relationships (not just categories)
- You need edge properties (strength, confidence, direction)
- The diagram will be reused across pages
- You want interactive hover details
</Aside>

## Common Patterns

### Simple Causal Chain

```yaml
nodes:
  - { id: a, label: Root Cause, type: leaf }
  - { id: b, label: Mediator, type: intermediate }
  - { id: c, label: Outcome, type: effect }
edges:
  - { source: a, target: b, strength: strong }
  - { source: b, target: c, strength: strong }
```

### Multiple Converging Causes

```yaml
nodes:
  - { id: a, label: Factor A, type: leaf }
  - { id: b, label: Factor B, type: leaf }
  - { id: c, label: Factor C, type: leaf }
  - { id: outcome, label: Outcome, type: effect }
edges:
  - { source: a, target: outcome, strength: strong }
  - { source: b, target: outcome, strength: medium }
  - { source: c, target: outcome, strength: weak }
```

### Hierarchical Factors

```yaml
nodes:
  # Root inputs
  - { id: input-1, label: External Factor, type: leaf }
  - { id: input-2, label: Resource, type: leaf }
  # Derived factors
  - { id: derived, label: Combined Effect, type: cause }
  # Direct factors
  - { id: direct-1, label: Capability, type: intermediate }
  - { id: direct-2, label: Constraint, type: intermediate }
  # Target
  - { id: outcome, label: Final Outcome, type: effect }
edges:
  - { source: input-1, target: derived }
  - { source: input-2, target: derived }
  - { source: derived, target: direct-1 }
  - { source: derived, target: direct-2 }
  - { source: direct-1, target: outcome, strength: strong }
  - { source: direct-2, target: outcome, strength: medium, effect: decreases }
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't: Too Many Leaf Nodes

Having 8+ leaf nodes creates a very wide top layer:

```yaml
# Bad: 8 parallel leaf nodes
nodes:
  - { id: a, type: leaf }
  - { id: b, type: leaf }
  - { id: c, type: leaf }
  # ... 5 more
```

**Fix:** Group related factors into intermediate nodes, or split into multiple diagrams.

### Don't: Feedback Loops in Edges

```yaml
# Bad: Creates cycles
edges:
  - { source: a, target: b }
  - { source: b, target: c }
  - { source: c, target: a }  # Loop!
```

**Fix:** Remove the loop edge and note the feedback in the description.

### Don't: Long Node Labels

```yaml
# Bad
- { id: x, label: "This is a very long label explaining everything" }

# Good
- { id: x, label: "Key Factor", description: "Detailed explanation here" }
```

### Don't: All Same Strength

```yaml
# Bad: No visual hierarchy
edges:
  - { source: a, target: x, strength: medium }
  - { source: b, target: x, strength: medium }
  - { source: c, target: x, strength: medium }

# Good: Differentiate importance
edges:
  - { source: a, target: x, strength: strong }
  - { source: b, target: x, strength: medium }
  - { source: c, target: x, strength: weak }
```

## Integration with Pages

### Using TransitionModelContent

For AI Transition Model pages, diagrams are automatically rendered by `TransitionModelContent`:

```mdx
import {TransitionModelContent} from '@components/wiki/TransitionModelContent';

<TransitionModelContent slug="compute" />
```

### Standalone Viewer

Link to the standalone diagram viewer for presentations or full-screen viewing:

```
/diagrams?entity=tmc-compute
```
