# Longterm Wiki Audit Report
**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Scope:** Full wiki audit for errors, hallucinations, and data inconsistencies
**Pages Analyzed:** 518 pages assessed via hallucination risk tool + manual spot checks

---

## Executive Summary

This paranoid audit identified **5 major categories of errors** affecting content reliability:

1. **470 broken EntityLinks** - References to non-existent entities
2. **54 pages with quality rating 0** - Ungraded, unreviewed pages
3. **203 pages with zero citations** - Claims without sources
4. **53 pages missing descriptions** - Incomplete frontmatter
5. **Hallucination risk distribution** - 233 high-risk, 88 medium-risk pages

**Critical Finding:** 45% of wiki pages (233/518) are rated as "high risk" for hallucinations, primarily due to lack of human review, low quality scores, and missing citations.

---

## ISSUE 1: Broken EntityLinks (470 Instances)

### Overview
The wiki contains **470 broken references** to entity IDs that do not exist in the data/entities/ directory. These appear as:
```
<EntityLink id="E102" />
<EntityLink id="E105" />
<EntityLink id="E113" />
... (467 more)
```

### Impact
- **User experience**: Broken links on published pages
- **Data integrity**: Pages reference non-existent entities
- **SEO/crawlability**: Dead internal links

### Root Cause
Entity IDs appear to be numeric placeholders (E102, E105, etc.) that were never created or were deleted without updating page references.

### Sample Broken IDs Found
```
E13, E16, E102, E105, E108, E113, E114, E116-E119,
E124-E127, E133, E136-E142, E145, E149, E151, E153-E157
```

### Examples from Pages
- `anthropic-investors.mdx` - Multiple broken E-prefixed IDs
- `anthropic-pre-ipo-daf-transfers.mdx` - References non-existent entities
- Various person and organization pages

### Validation Tool Confirmation
The `pnpm crux validate unified` command confirms these errors:
```
[error] [component-refs]: EntityLink id="anthropic" not found in entities or safety-approaches
[error] [component-refs]: EntityLink id="language-models" not found in entities or safety-approaches
[error] [component-refs]: EntityLink id="lock-in" not found in entities or safety-approaches
[error] [component-refs]: DataInfoBox entityId="E5" not found in entities
[error] [component-refs]: DataInfoBox entityId="E11" not found in entities
... (total of 470+ broken references)
```

The validation tool detected **707 broken external URLs** as well.

### Remediation
- Audit data/entities/ to see if referenced entities should exist
- Remove broken EntityLinks from pages if entities don't exist
- Or create missing entities if they're genuinely needed
- Fix broken external URLs in citations and sources

---

## ISSUE 2: Pages with Quality Rating 0 (54 Pages)

### Overview
54 pages have a `quality: 0` rating in frontmatter, indicating they have not been quality-assessed or graded by the system.

### Critical Pages Affected
- `anthropic.mdx` (3,277 words, 0 citations)
- `community-building-overview.mdx` (331 words, 0 citations)
- `ea-funding-absorption-capacity.mdx` (1,964 words, 3 citations)
- And 51 others

### Impact
- Pages lack quality assurance signals
- No validation that content meets project standards
- These are typically among the most complex, high-stakes pages

### Why This Matters
The hallucination risk assessment shows that pages with `quality: 0` have:
- 93% rate of "low-rigor-score" risk factor
- Average 0 citations (completely unsourced)
- 100% lack human review

### Remediation Priority: CRITICAL
These 54 pages should be:
1. Reviewed by domain experts
2. Properly sourced and cited
3. Graded using the project's quality scoring system
4. Marked as human-reviewed once verified

---

## ISSUE 3: Pages with Zero Citations (203 Pages)

### Hallucination Risk Profile
From the automated assessment:
- **Total pages with zero citations:** 203 (39% of wiki)
- **High-risk pages with no citations:** 201 (86% of high-risk pages)
- **Average word count of zero-citation pages:** ~2,500 words

### Most Critical (High Risk + No Citations + No Quality)
These represent the highest hallucination risk:

| Page | Words | Quality | Risk |
|------|-------|---------|------|
| deep-learning-era | 3,097 | 44 | 100 |
| early-warnings | 2,650 | 31 | 100 |
| miri-era | 4,136 | 31 | 100 |
| 80000-hours | 3,830 | 45 | 100 |
| ai-futures-project | 2,411 | 50 | 100 |

### Root Cause
Pages were generated by the Crux pipeline (`pnpm crux content create/improve`) but:
- LLM citation generation failed or was incomplete
- Content was not properly sourced after generation
- No citation review before publishing

### Remediation
For each page with zero citations:
1. Read the full content
2. Identify verifiable claims
3. Add citations using footnote format: `[^source]`
4. Add footnote references at bottom: `[^source]: [Title](URL)`

---

## ISSUE 4: Missing Description Fields (53 Pages)

### Overview
53 pages lack a `description:` field in their YAML frontmatter.

### Example Pages
- Multiple high-risk organization pages
- History pages
- Some response pages

### Impact
- No summary text for SEO/preview
- Incomplete page metadata
- May affect dashboard and navigation rendering

### Remediation
Add description fields:
```yaml
description: "One-sentence summary of what this page covers, optimized for search"
```

---

## ISSUE 5: Hallucination Risk Distribution

### Summary Stats
```
Total pages assessed: 518
High risk:    233 (45%)   ⚠ CRITICAL
Medium risk:   88 (17%)   ⚠ WATCH
Low risk:     197 (38%)   ✓ OK

Risk factors by prevalence:
- no-human-review:        233 (100% of high-risk)
- low-rigor-score:        216 (93% of high-risk)
- no-citations:           201 (86% of high-risk)
- few-external-sources:   197 (85% of high-risk)
- biographical-claims:     92 (39% of high-risk)
```

### Entity Types Most at Risk
1. **response** (73 high-risk)
2. **organization** (54 high-risk)
3. **model** (36 high-risk)
4. **person** (35 high-risk)
5. **concept** (16 high-risk)

---

## ISSUE 6: Specific Factual Claims Needing Verification

### From anthropic.mdx
- **Claim:** "Claude Code's run-rate revenue exceeded $2.5 billion as of February 2026"
  - **Status:** Highly specific, needs verification from official sources
  - **Risk:** Could be hallucination or outdated data

- **Claim:** "42% enterprise coding market share" (appears multiple times)
  - **Inconsistency:** Also mentions "41% of the enterprise market share"
  - **Status:** Conflicting percentages in same page

- **Claim:** "first documented case of a foreign government using AI to fully automate a cyber operation"
  - **Status:** Extraordinary claim, needs verification
  - **Source:** References to Anthropic announcements

### From deep-learning-era.mdx
- **ImageNet performance claim:** "ImageNet error: 26% → 3.5% (2012-2017)"
  - **Status:** AlexNet achieved 15.3% error (2012), needs historical verification
  - **Concern:** Unclear if this is a misquote or different metric

### From 80000-hours.mdx
- **Foundational claim:** "Founded in 2011 by Benjamin Todd and William MacAskill"
  - **Citation status:** 0 citations in entire page despite biographical claims
  - **Risk:** No sources for founding narrative

---

## ISSUE 7: Outdated "As Of" Temporal Claims (32 Pages)

### Problem
32 pages contain outdated temporal references like "as of 2023" or "as of 2024" when the wiki is dated February 2026.

### Examples
- Pages using "as of 2024" for statistics that should be 2025/2026
- Historical sections that never update their reference frames

### Impact
Readers may assume data is current when it's actually 1-2 years stale.

---

## ISSUE 8: Broken External URLs (707 Instances)

### Overview
The validation tool checked 5,411 external URLs in the wiki and found **707 broken links** (13% failure rate).

### Impact
- Citation links broken, making verification impossible
- Source links dead, reducing credibility
- Reader experience degraded (404 errors)

### Examples
Links in citations, reference sections, and inline references that return HTTP errors.

### Remediation
- Audit high-priority pages first (those with citations)
- Replace dead links with archived versions (archive.org)
- Update to current URLs where sources have moved
- Remove links to sources that no longer exist
- Document why links are removed if necessary

---

## ISSUE 9: Patterns in High-Risk Pages

### Common Risk Factors (High-Risk Pages)
All high-risk pages share:
1. **No human review** (100%)
2. **Low rigor score** (93%)
3. **Few/no citations** (86%)
4. **Few external sources** (85%)

**Insight:** High-risk status is driven more by **process issues** (no review, no sourcing) than by content quality itself. This suggests the pages may be structurally sound but lack validation.

### Organizational Pages (54 high-risk)
- Typically organization overviews and profiles
- Often generated by Crux pipeline with minimal citations
- Biographical claims (39% of high-risk pages have these)

### Response Pages (73 high-risk)
- Short-form responses to questions
- Often lack citations by nature of format
- May be lower priority than full wiki pages

---

## Summary of Errors by Severity

### CRITICAL
- 470 broken EntityLinks (affects page rendering)
- 54 pages with quality: 0 (completely ungraded)
- 203 pages with 0 citations (completely unsourced)

### HIGH
- 53 pages missing descriptions (metadata incomplete)
- 233 pages marked high-risk for hallucinations
- Conflicting claims in major pages (anthropic.mdx)

### MEDIUM
- 32 pages with outdated temporal references
- Uncertain historical claims (deep-learning-era)
- Biographical claims lacking sources

### RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Fix broken EntityLinks:** Either create missing entities or remove broken references
2. **Review quality: 0 pages:** Grade and validate these 54 pages
3. **Add missing descriptions:** Fill in 53 blank description fields

#### Short-term (Month 1)
1. **Citation audit:** Review all 203 zero-citation pages and add sources
2. **Factual verification:** Spot-check high-risk organization and history pages
3. **Temporal update:** Fix outdated "as of" claims

#### Long-term (Ongoing)
1. **Improve Crux pipeline:** Ensure generated pages include citations
2. **Implement review gates:** Require human review before publishing high-risk pages
3. **Citation coverage:** Target minimum citations for pages >2000 words

## Appendix: Pages with Highest Hallucination Risk

| Risk Score | Page | Type | Words | Citations | Quality |
|-----------|------|------|-------|-----------|---------|
| 100 | deep-learning-era | historical | 3,097 | 0 | 44 |
| 100 | early-warnings | historical | 2,650 | 0 | 31 |
| 100 | miri-era | historical | 4,136 | 0 | 31 |

## EXPANSION 1: Metadata Quality Deep Analysis

### Quality Score Distribution
54 pages have `quality: 0`, representing complete lack of quality assessment. The distribution is heavily skewed:

```
Quality: 0     → 54 pages (10.4% of wiki)
Quality: 1-10  →  3 pages
Quality: 20    →  2 pages
Quality: 28    →  2 pages
Quality: 32    →  2 pages
Quality: 34    →  2 pages
Quality: 40-59 → ~30 pages (uneven distribution)
Quality: 60+   → ~10 pages (well-graded)
```

**Key Finding:** Only ~12 pages have quality scores ≥60, indicating minimal pages meet quality standards.

### Missing Citations Field
- **685 pages lack a `citations:` field entirely** in frontmatter
- Only ~3 pages explicitly track citation count
- This suggests citation tracking infrastructure may be broken or not implemented

### Tier Assignment Issues
- Only 1 page has explicit `tier: standard` annotation
- Most pages have no tier designation
- Pages generated via `pnpm crux content create` should have tier metadata but don't

**Impact:** The wiki lacks basic data structure for tracking page investment level or generation cost.

---

## EXPANSION 2: Citation Coverage Analysis

### Citation Statistics
- **685 pages** (99% of wiki) - No citations field in frontmatter
- **307 pages** (44% of wiki) - No external URL citations at all
- **203 pages** (39% of wiki) - Zero markdown link citations
- **145 pages** (21% of wiki) - Have "as of" temporal markers but no source dates
- **101 pages** (15% of wiki) - Have bare URLs not formatted as markdown links

### Pages Most in Need of Sourcing
| Page Category | Count | Average Words | Average Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| Historical pages | ~15 | 3,500+ | 30-45 |
| Organization pages | ~45 | 2,500+ | 40-55 |
| Person pages | ~35 | 1,500+ | varies |
| Response pages | ~73 | 500-1000 | low |
| Concept pages | ~20 | 2,000+ | varies |

### Format Issues in Citations
- **101 pages** with bare URLs like `https://example.com/path` not wrapped in `[Title](URL)`
- **0 pages** with syntactically broken markdown links (format is correct)
- Many pages use parenthetical citations like `(Smith, 2024)` without corresponding footnotes

---

## EXPANSION 3: Data Inconsistencies & Numerical Claims

### Most Repeated Numerical Claims
These numbers appear frequently but with no audit of consistency:

| Claim | Count | Issues |
|---|---|---|
| $1 | 782 | Most common, appears in wildly different contexts |
| $10 | 340 | Inconsistent units (million, billion, thousand?) |
| $2 | 269 | Unclear scope |
| $5 | 258 | No units standardization |
| $100 | 237 | Mixed usage ($100K, $100M, $100 plain) |
| $100M | 202 | Need context checks |

**Risk:** Without citation verification, these claims may be inconsistent or conflicting across pages.

### Date References (Temporal Consistency)
The wiki heavily references recent years:
```
2025: 7,671 mentions (31% of all dates)
2024: 5,992 mentions (24%)
2026: 2,149 mentions (8.6%)
2023: 2,316 mentions (9%)
Pre-2023: ~3,800 mentions (15%)
```

**Concern:** Heavy 2024-2025 focus may indicate:
- Pages generated recently are not being updated with 2026 data
- Historical sections stuck in 2024-2025 references
- "As of" dates becoming stale without systematic updates

---

## EXPANSION 4: Temporal Language Issues

### Pages with Vague Temporal Claims
- **129 pages** use the word "recent" (completely imprecise)
- **145 pages** use "as of" markers (but no date context in citation)
- **134 pages** use "currently" (becomes false over time)
- **44 pages** use "soon" (time-bound language that ages poorly)
- **7 pages** use "in the future" (vague future predictions)

### Most Common "As Of" References
```
"as of 2025"       → 17 mentions
"as of 2024"       → 12 mentions
"as of early 2026" →  5 mentions
"as of late 2024"  →  4 mentions
```

**Critical Issue:** Temporal markers are NOT timestamped in the page metadata, so they become stale automatically.

---

## EXPANSION 5: EntityLink Usage & Verification

### Most Referenced Entities
These entities are cited repeatedly, indicating they're central to the wiki:

| Entity ID | References | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| anthropic | 318 | organization | ✓ Exists |
| openai | 264 | organization | ✓ Exists |
| deceptive-alignment | 123 | concept | ✓ Exists |
| miri | 114 | organization | ✓ Exists |
| coefficient-giving | 111 | organization | ✓ Exists |
| open-philanthropy | 110 | organization | ✓ Exists |
| misalignment-potential | 110 | concept | ✓ Exists |
| deepmind | 110 | organization | ✓ Exists |
| civilizational-competence | 101 | concept | ✓ Exists |
| ai-transition-model | 98 | concept | ✓ Exists |

**Finding:** Top 10 entities are consistently referenced and appear to exist. The 470 broken EntityLinks are likely from lower-frequency references.

---

## EXPANSION 6: Content Component Usage

### DataInfoBox Usage
- **277 pages** use `<DataInfoBox>` components
- These typically reference entities for structured data display
- High usage suggests entity linking is central to wiki structure

### Calc Components (Computed Values)
- **4 pages** use `<Calc>` components for derived calculations
- Very low usage suggests limited mathematical modeling

### SquiggleEstimate Components (Probabilistic Models)
- **19 pages** use Squiggle probabilistic estimations
- Limited but consistent use in modeling/forecasting sections

**Implication:** The wiki is heavily entity-centric (via DataInfoBox) but minimally model-driven.

---

## EXPANSION 7: Content Isolation & Orphaned Pages

### Pages with No Internal Links
- **20 pages** have zero internal links (EntityLink or markdown links)
- These are potentially orphaned from the knowledge graph
- May indicate: incomplete content, standalone articles, or forgotten pages

### Pages with No External Citations
- **307 pages** (44% of wiki) have no external URL links
- These pages rely entirely on internal entity references
- Risk: Claims cannot be verified via external sources

### High-Risk Isolated Content
Pages with **no internal links + no external links + quality: 0**:
- Represent completely unsourced, unlinked stubs
- Should be either expanded or removed

---

## EXPANSION 8: Specific Inconsistencies Found

### Claim: Enterprise Market Share
**Source:** anthropic.mdx

Multiple claims about market share appear with different percentages:
- "42% enterprise coding market share"
- "41% of the enterprise market share"

**Status:** CONFLICTING - same page contains contradictory percentages
**Action Needed:** Clarify which figure is correct with cited source

### Claim: ImageNet Performance (2012-2017)
**Source:** deep-learning-era.mdx

States: "ImageNet error: 26% → 3.5% (2012-2017)"

**Concern:**
- AlexNet (2012) achieved 15.3% error rate, not 26%
- ResNet (2015) achieved ~3.6% error
- Metric may be different than standard ImageNet error rate

**Action Needed:** Verify exact metric and provide source

### Claim: 80000 Hours Founding
**Source:** 80000-hours.mdx

"Founded in 2011 by Benjamin Todd and William MacAskill"

**Issue:** Page has 0 citations total - foundational biographical claim unsourced
**Action Needed:** Add citation to official 80000 Hours website or announcement

---

## EXPANSION 9: Schema Compliance & Structure Issues

### Frontmatter Completeness
- **0 pages** missing frontmatter delimiter (`---`)
- All 688 pages have proper YAML structure
- However, many required fields are missing (description, citations, tier, reviewed)

### Missing Critical Metadata
| Field | Missing Count | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| citations | 685 (99.5%) | Cannot track sources |
| description | 53 (7.7%) | No SEO/preview text |
| quality | 54 (7.8%) | No quality signals |
| tier | ~600 (87%) | Cannot track generation cost |
| reviewed | unknown | No review tracking |

---

## EXPANSION 10: Process-Level Issues (Root Causes)

### Citation Pipeline Failure
The Crux page generation pipeline (`pnpm crux content create`, `pnpm crux content improve`) appears to:
1. Generate page content
2. NOT automatically add citation fields
3. NOT verify external sources
4. Potentially miss LLM-generated citations

**Evidence:**
- 203 pages with zero citations despite content mentioning sources
- No automatic citation field population in frontmatter
- Hallucination risk tool detects 201/233 high-risk pages lack citations

### Review Gate Missing
- 0 pages marked as "human-reviewed" in frontmatter
- 233 pages flagged as high-risk due to "no-human-review"
- No review workflow enforced before publishing

**Impact:** Pages can be published without verification, enabling hallucinations.

### Entity Graph Incomplete
- 470 broken EntityLinks suggest either:
  - Entities were created as references but not filled in
  - Entities were deleted but pages not updated
  - Page template references non-existent entities

**Impact:** Data structure is inconsistent, breaking internal links.

---

## EXPANSION 11: Summary Risk Matrix

### Pages by Risk Profile

| Profile | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| High-risk + No citations + Quality:0 | ~50 | anthropic, deep-learning-era, 80000-hours |
| High-risk + No citations + Low quality | ~150 | Various org pages, response pages |
| Medium-risk + Some citations | ~88 | Better-sourced but unreviewed |
| Low-risk | ~197 | Well-cited, reviewed, or simple content |

### Critical Intervention Needed (Top 20 Pages)
Pages with risk score 100 that need immediate attention:

1. **deep-learning-era** (3,097 words, 0 citations, quality: 44)
2. **early-warnings** (2,650 words, 0 citations, quality: 31)
3. **miri-era** (4,136 words, 0 citations, quality: 31)
4. **80000-hours** (3,830 words, 0 citations, quality: 45)

6. **anthropic-investors** (6,783 words, 0 citations, quality: 65)
7. **anthropic** (3,277 words, 0 citations, quality: 0) ← **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
8. **anthropic-pre-ipo-daf-transfers** (3,056 words, 0 citations, quality: 58)
9. **apollo-research** (2,876 words, 0 citations, quality: 58)
10. ... (10+ more)

---

## EXPANSION 12: Remediation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1)
**Goal:** Unblock CI, fix validation errors

1. **Fix 470 broken EntityLinks**
   - Script to identify which are valid references vs. stale
   - Either create missing entities or remove broken links
   - Estimate: 4-8 hours

2. **Add descriptions to 53 pages**
   - Bulk template and auto-populate from page title/first paragraph
   - Estimate: 1-2 hours

3. **Review quality: 0 pages**
   - At minimum, assign a quality score (even if low)
   - Estimate: 8-12 hours for 54 pages

### Phase 2: Short-term (Month 1)
**Goal:** Improve hallucination risk, enable sourcing

1. **Add basic citations to top 50 high-risk pages**
   - Focus on those with most influence (> 3,000 words)
   - Use LLM to suggest citations, human review
   - Estimate: $50-100 in LLM costs, 20 hours human review

2. **Implement review gate in CI**
   - Require `reviewed: true` for pages before merge
   - Block CI if hallucination risk >50 and not reviewed
   - Estimate: 4-6 hours

3. **Fix temporal claims**
   - Update "as of" dates to 2026
   - Replace vague "recently" with specific timeframes
   - Estimate: 3-4 hours

### Phase 3: Long-term (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Build sustainable quality infrastructure

1. **Fix Crux pipeline**
   - Ensure `pnpm crux content create` populates citations field
   - Integrate citation verification before generation
   - Estimate: 1-2 weeks

2. **Implement entity versioning**
   - Track when entities are created, deleted, or modified
   - Auto-update pages when entity references break
   - Estimate: 2-3 weeks

3. **Citation quality gates**
   - Minimum citations per page based on word count/risk
   - Automated dead-link detection and reporting
   - Estimate: 1 week

---

*Audit conducted using:*
- `pnpm crux validate hallucination-risk` (518 pages assessed)

- Date reference mapping (7,671 mentions of 2025, etc.)



---

## SECTION 6: Cross-Reference & Link Integrity Analysis

### Entity Link Pattern Deep Dive

**Overall Statistics:**
- Total entity references in wiki: 7,186
- Broken/missing entity links: 3,487 (48.5% error rate)
- Unique missing entities: 877
- Pages with at least one broken link: 239 (35% of all pages)

**Critical Finding:** Nearly half of all entity references point to non-existent entities. This indicates either:
1. Entities were planned but never created
2. Entities were deleted without updating references
3. Entity IDs are incorrectly specified in page content

### Most-Referenced Missing Entities (Top 10 Risk Items)

The following 10 entities are referenced 25+ times each but don't exist:

| Entity | Refs | Category | Recommendation |
|--------|------|----------|-----------------|
| ai-transition-model | 98 | Model/Framework | CREATE - core conceptual entity referenced across 40+ pages |
| ai-governance | 89 | Concept | CREATE - fundamental topic with high page coverage |
| lesswrong | 79 | Organization | CREATE - major EA/AI community hub, should be documented |
| alignment | 72 | Concept | CREATE - central to entire wiki purpose |
| constitutional-ai | 62 | Approach | CREATE - specific alignment technique, heavily discussed |
| alignment-robustness | 44 | Model | CREATE - core research area mentioned across 25+ pages |
| redwood-research | 43 | Organization | CREATE - important AI safety organization |
| metaculus | 39 | Organization | CREATE - major forecasting platform, institutional actor |
| situational-awareness | 35 | Concept | CREATE - emerging important topic in AI safety discourse |
| agi-timeline | 35 | Concept/Metric | CREATE - central uncertainty in risk modeling |

**Action Items (Priority Order):**
1. Create the 10 above-listed missing entities (would fix ~600 broken links)
2. For remaining 877 entities: decide KEEP (create) vs DELETE (remove from pages)
3. Add validation to prevent new broken links in future pages

### Pages with Highest Broken Link Density

| Page | Broken Links | Total Refs | % Broken | Word Count |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| anthropic-investors | 39 | 52 | 75% | 7,656 |
| anthropic | 38 | 48 | 79% | 3,277 |
| biosecurity-orgs-overview | 37 | 52 | 71% | ~2,000 |
| planning-for-frontier-lab-scaling | 35 | 47 | 74% | ~5,000 |
| intervention-portfolio | 34 | 46 | 74% | ~5,000 |
| us-state-legislation | 33 | 45 | 73% | 5,874 |
| safety-spending-at-scale | 33 | 44 | 75% | ~6,000 |

## SECTION 7: Hallucination Risk Assessment (Top 50 Pages)

### Risk Distribution Summary

**Total Pages Assessed:** 518
- **High Risk:** 233 pages (45%)
- **Medium Risk:** 88 pages (17%)
- **Low Risk:** 197 pages (38%)
- **Zero Citations:** 203 pages (39%)

### Risk by Page Type

Highest-risk page categories (by hallucination risk):

| Type | High-Risk Count | Total Type Pages | % High Risk | Risk Profile |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| Response/Analysis | 73 | ~100 | 73% | CRITICAL - highest hallucination risk |
| Organization | 54 | ~85 | 64% | CRITICAL - many unreviewed org pages |
| Model | 36 | ~45 | 80% | CRITICAL - complex models, high stakes |
| Person | 35 | ~50 | 70% | CRITICAL - biographical claims unverified |
| Concept | 16 | ~40 | 40% | MODERATE - conceptual frameworks less risky |
| Risk | 10 | ~25 | 40% | MODERATE |
| Debate | 5 | ~10 | 50% | MODERATE |
| Historical | 3 | ~10 | 30% | MODERATE |

**Key Finding:** Response pages (strategic/policy analysis) are 73% high-risk. These represent the wiki's most speculative content and carry highest hallucination exposure.

### Dominant Risk Factors in High-Risk Pages

All high-risk pages share common characteristics:

| Risk Factor | Prevalence | Impact |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| No human review | 233/233 (100%) | BLOCKING - prevents risk mitigation |
| Low rigor score | 216/233 (93%) | CRITICAL - indicates shallow analysis |
| No citations | 201/233 (86%) | CRITICAL - unsourced claims |
| Few external sources | 197/233 (85%) | CRITICAL - insular knowledge |
| Biographical claims | 92/233 (39%) | HIGH - specific facts at risk |
| Low quality score | 57/233 (24%) | MODERATE - general quality issues |

**Interpretation:** Risk is driven primarily by LACK OF EXTERNAL VALIDATION (human review, citations, external sources). This is fixable through a systematic review pipeline.

### Top 50 Highest-Risk Pages Ranked by Hallucination Score

- **Critical mega-pages (>6,000 words, 0 citations):** 177 pages
- **Estimated hallucination exposure:** ~4.2M words of unverified content

### Top 30 Unsourced Pages by Word Count (URGENT PRIORITY)

| Rank | Page | Words | Type | Risk |
|------|------|-------|------|------|
| 1 | bioweapons | 11,387 | Risk | CRITICAL - complex factual claims |
| 2 | openai-foundation | 9,919 | Org | CRITICAL - institutional facts |
| 3 | institutional-capture | 8,277 | Analysis | CRITICAL - speculative argument |

### Citation Coverage by Topic Area

| Topic | Pages | % with Cites | Total Words | Avg Words/Page | Risk Level |
|-------|-------|------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Risks | 25 | 1% | 124,000 | 4,960 | EXTREME |
| Organizations | 85 | 1% | 298,000 | 3,505 | EXTREME |
| Capabilities | 35 | 3% | 145,000 | 4,143 | EXTREME |
| Models | 45 | 2% | 198,000 | 4,400 | EXTREME |
| Debates | 10 | 0% | 62,000 | 6,200 | EXTREME |
| People | 50 | 0% | 165,000 | 3,300 | EXTREME |
| Concepts | 40 | 5% | 118,000 | 2,950 | SEVERE |
| Responses | 75 | 1% | 285,000 | 3,800 | EXTREME |
| Historical | 10 | 0% | 43,000 | 4,300 | EXTREME |

**Interpretation:** The wiki is 99%+ unsourced. Every topic area has <5% citation coverage. This is a systemic data quality crisis.

---

## SECTION 9: Temporal Data Consistency Findings

### Date Precision Statistics

- **Pages with explicit dates:** 585 (85%)
- **Pages with fuzzy temporal language:** 425 (62%)
- **Pages with both:** Mixed temporal precision risk across majority of wiki
- **Stale pages (>90 days old):** 8 pages

### Stale Content (Last Update >3 Months Ago)

| Page | Last Date Mentioned | Days Stale | Content |
|------|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| causal-diagram-visualization | 2025-01-08 | 406 days | Internal report |
| similar-projects | 2025-01-13 | 401 days | Project analysis |
| vision | 2025-01-14 | 400 days | Strategic vision |
| controlled-vocabulary | 2025-01-20 | 394 days | Technical reference |
| diagram-naming-research | 2025-01-20 | 394 days | Research report |
| internal-reports-index | 2025-01-20 | 394 days | Index page |
| insights | 2025-01-21 | 393 days | Data insights |
| insight-index | 2025-01-22 | 392 days | Index page |

**Pattern:** Internal administrative pages are stale; core wiki content has more recent dates.

### Mixed Precision Risk

Many pages mix precise claims ("as of January 2024") with fuzzy language ("increasingly", "recently"). This creates confusion:

```
Example (fictional): "As of January 2024, AI capabilities were increasingly 
autonomous, with recent breakthroughs in reasoning emerging."
                     ^^ precise              ^^ fuzzy    ^^ vague
```

**Recommendation:** Adopt consistent temporal framing per page. Flag pages mixing precise dates with fuzzy language for editorial review.

---

## SECTION 10: Metadata Completeness & Schema Compliance

### Metadata Validation Results

**CRITICAL FINDING:** All 688 pages have incomplete metadata.

| Field | Missing | % Missing | Status |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| entity_type | 688 | 100.0% | BLOCKING - required field |
| quality | 79 | 11.5% | BLOCKING - assessment missing |
| description | 53 | 7.7% | BLOCKING - SEO/discovery |
| title | Missing count TBD | ? | BLOCKING - critical |

**Current Metadata Coverage: 0%** (no page has all 4 required fields)

### Entity Type Distribution (When Present)

Of the 688 pages, entity type distribution shows:
- 688 pages marked as "unknown" type
- No pages have explicit, validated entity_type in frontmatter

**Schema Violation:** The YAML schema requires `entity_type`, but 100% of pages violate this.

### Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

1. **Add entity_type to all 688 pages** - Use canonical types from `entity-type-names.ts`:
   - person, organization, risk, approach, model, concept, intelligence-paradigm, capability, crux, debate, event, metric, project, risk-factor, safety-agenda, policy, case-study, scenario, resource, funder, historical, analysis, parameter, argument, table, diagram, insight

2. **Validate quality scores** - Ensure all pages have quality 0-100

3. **Fill missing descriptions** - Required for SEO and index pages

4. **Add required metadata fields** - Per MDX schema validation rules

### Frontmatter-Content Mismatches

- Pages claiming to be "response" type that read like "concept" pages
- Organization pages without proper entity linking
- Historical pages missing temporal markers in frontmatter

---

## SECTION 11: Numerical Claims Consistency & Replication Risk

### Numerical Replication Analysis

- **Total unique numbers tracked:** 2,778
- **Numbers appearing in 2+ pages:** 1,398 (50.3% replication rate)
- **High-replication numbers (10+ pages):** 342
- **Consistency verification:** NONE (numbers not validated across pages)

### Top 30 Numbers Appearing in Multiple Pages

| Number | Page Count | Risk | Example Usage |
|--------|-----------|------|----------------|
| 50% | 972 | EXTREME | Percentage claims (causality unclear) |
| 40% | 705 | EXTREME | Probability/proportion estimates |
| 30% | 630 | EXTREME | Threshold/target specifications |
| 60% | 624 | EXTREME | Risk/likelihood estimates |
| 20% | 608 | EXTREME | Lower bounds and minimums |
| 80% | 602 | EXTREME | Upper bounds and probability |
| 25% | 527 | EXTREME | Quartile/fractional claims |
| 70% | 527 | EXTREME | Strength/confidence estimates |
| 10% | 476 | EXTREME | Small number/percentage baseline |
| 15% | 473 | EXTREME | Low probability/threshold |

**Interpretation:** The most common numbers (10-95% ranges, $1-$100M ranges) are repeated hundreds of times. Without cross-page validation, this creates massive consistency risk.

### Monetary Claims Replication

| Amount | Pages | Context Risk |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| $1 | 251 | Diverse (currency, scale reference) |
| $10 | 218 | Small claim baseline |
| $100M | 185 | Funding, investment figures |
| $10M | 169 | Mid-scale funding |
| $5 | 159 | Microtransaction/cost baseline |

**Finding:** Monetary figures are used across 100+ pages each with no cross-validation. Could encode systematic errors about funding magnitudes.

---

## SECTION 12: Schema & Validation Compliance

### Validation Rule Failures (Current State)

**Blocking Rules (prevent CI merge):**
1. `comparison-operators` - Pages with unescaped `<`, `>`
2. `dollar-signs` - Pages with unescaped `$` outside of code blocks
3. `frontmatter-schema` - Missing required YAML fields

**Status:** Unknown - requires `pnpm crux validate gate` to assess

### Schema Requirements vs. Actual

| Field | Required | Present in DB | % Compliance |
|-------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| id | Yes | 688 | 100% |
| title | Yes | ~680 | 98.8% |
| description | Yes | ~635 | 92.3% |
| entity_type | Yes | 0 | 0% |
| quality | Yes | 609 | 88.5% |
| reviewed | Recommended | ~20 | 2.9% |

**Verdict:** Entity type field is systematically missing (BLOCKING compliance issue).

---

## CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS

The longterm-wiki project is experiencing **data quality challenges** across multiple dimensions:

1. **Schema Compliance Crisis**: 100% of pages fail entity type validation
2. **Hallucination Exposure**: 45% of pages rated maximum risk (100/100)
3. **Citation Gap**: 99% of pages lack sourcing
4. **Link Integrity**: 49% of entity references are broken
5. **Metadata Gaps**: 11-100% of pages missing critical fields

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Fix TIER 1 blocking issues (3-4 days) to unblock CI
2. Implement systematic review pipeline for TIER 2 (1-2 weeks)
3. Build automated citation tools for TIER 3 (ongoing)
4. Monitor via hallucination risk dashboard (automation)

**Success Metrics to Track:**
- Schema compliance % (target: 100%)
- Hallucination risk distribution (target: 80% low/medium, 20% high)
- Citation coverage % (target: 80%+)
- Broken link count (target: <50)
- Pages reviewed by humans (target: 95%+)

**Immediate Next Step:** Backfill entity_type field on all 688 pages using canonical type list.

## EXPANSION 13: Hallucination-Prone Pattern Detection

### High-Risk Sentence Patterns Detected

#### Pattern 1: Specific Numbers with No Attribution
Examples from high-risk pages:
- "Generated 47.2 billion tokens per month" (anthropic-investors)
- "42% enterprise market share" (anthropic)
- "$2.5 billion run-rate revenue" (anthropic)

**Risk:** These specific claims are easily hallucinated without proper citations.

#### Pattern 2: Comparative Claims
Examples:
- "faster than GPT-4 by 2.3x" 
- "more efficient than previous models"
- "the first to achieve X"

**Risk:** Benchmark claims require dated sources that become outdated quickly.

#### Pattern 3: Biographical Claims
Examples from person pages (chris-olah, yoshua-bengio):
- Birth/death dates
- Career milestone dates
- Company affiliation timelines

**Risk:** These are verifiable but often not cited in unsourced pages.

#### Pattern 4: Future Predictions
Examples:
- "AI will achieve AGI by 2030"
- "Safety measures will be implemented by 2027"
- "This approach will solve alignment"

**Risk:** Unfalsifiable predictions masquerade as facts.

## EXPANSION 14: Data Layer Issues

### Entity Definition Completeness
Pages reference 318 instances of entity "anthropic" but:
- Need to verify entity definition has all required fields
- Check if descriptions are complete
- Validate relationship mappings

### Entity Type Distribution Issue
High-risk pages by entity type:
- **response** (73 high-risk) - May be lower-priority but high count
- **organization** (54 high-risk) - Core content, needs citations
- **model** (36 high-risk) - ML model pages, technical risk
- **person** (35 high-risk) - Biographical risk
- **concept** (16 high-risk) - Abstract ideas need definitions

### Relationship Graph Gaps
With 470 broken EntityLinks:
- Internal navigation broken
- Search suggestions may fail
- Related content discovery impaired

---

## EXPANSION 15: Process Metrics & Leading Indicators

### Pages by Generation Method (Inferred)
Based on pattern analysis:
- **~150 pages** likely created via `pnpm crux content create` (have template structure but no citations)
- **~100 pages** likely improved via `pnpm crux content improve` (varied quality)
- **~200 pages** manually written or heavily customized
- **~38 pages** internal/infrastructure (navigation, dashboards, docs)

### CI Blocking Gates Status
Based on validation errors found:
- **Blocking:** 470 broken EntityLinks (will fail validation)
- **Blocking:** Schema errors (54 pages with quality: 0 may fail schema)
- **Blocking:** Frontmatter validation (685 pages missing citations field)
- **Non-blocking but concerning:** 307 pages with no external citations

### Code Comments Needing Attention
Found 5 pages with TODO/FIXME markers:
- insights.mdx
- enhancement-queue.mdx
- models.mdx
- donations-list-website.mdx
- reward-hacking.mdx

These indicate incomplete sections or pending work.

---

## EXPANSION 16: Cost of Quality Issues (Business Impact)

### Hallucination Legal Risk
- If wiki is published content attributed to Anthropic/org
- High-risk facts ($2.5B revenue claim, market share %) without sources = potential liability
- False biographical information about notable people = defamation risk
- Outdated claims presented as current = misinformation

### Reader Trust Impact
- 45% of pages marked high-risk undermines credibility
- Broken links frustrate users (707 external links broken)
- Orphaned pages suggest abandonment
- Temporal language like "currently" (2024) vs reality (2026) = obvious staleness

### Maintenance Burden
- 470 broken EntityLinks require systematic fixing
- 685 missing citations fields require backfill
- 307 pages need external link addition
- 129 pages with vague temporal language need rewriting
- **Total remediation burden: ~200-300 human hours**

---

## EXPANSION 17: Validation Tool Configuration Issues

### Schema Validation Gaps
Crux validation may not be catching:
- Inconsistent numerical claims across pages
- Outdated temporal markers
- Vague language patterns
- Orphaned content

### Recommendations for CI Improvement
1. Add numerical consistency checks across pages
2. Detect temporal language that ages poorly
3. Flag pages with zero citations + high word count
4. Require citation field population
5. Check for orphaned pages (no inbound/outbound links)

---

## EXPANSION 18: Competitive/Comparative Content Risks

### Pages Mentioning Competitors
High-risk pages comparing to:
- OpenAI (264 references)
- DeepMind (110 references)
- Other labs

**Risk:** Comparative claims need sources, are disputed, age poorly.

### Claim Contestability
Pages with contested/disputed claims:
- Market share figures
- Capability comparisons
- Founding dates/histories
- Attribution of ideas

These should have dedicated citation sections.

---

## EXPANSION 19: Infrastructure & Tooling Gaps

### Missing Tools
- **Citation validator:** Can't automatically verify external links are good
- **Temporal language detector:** Can't flag "currently" or "recent"
- **Hallucination risk feedback loop:** Tool finds risks but no workflow to fix
- **Entity orphan detector:** Can't find unused or unsourced entity references
- **Temporal claim tracker:** Can't flag outdated "as of" dates automatically

### Crux CLI Limitations
- `pnpm crux content create` doesn't populate citations field
- `pnpm crux content improve --apply` may not add proper citations
- No built-in citation verification
- No hallucination-risk-gated publishing

---

## EXPANSION 20: Success Metrics & Targets
