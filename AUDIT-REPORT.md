# Longterm Wiki Audit Report
**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Scope:** Full wiki audit for errors, hallucinations, and data inconsistencies
**Pages Analyzed:** 518 pages assessed via hallucination risk tool + manual spot checks

---

## Executive Summary

This paranoid audit identified **5 major categories of errors** affecting content reliability:

1. **470 broken EntityLinks** - References to non-existent entities
2. **54 pages with quality rating 0** - Ungraded, unreviewed pages
3. **203 pages with zero citations** - Claims without sources
4. **53 pages missing descriptions** - Incomplete frontmatter
5. **Hallucination risk distribution** - 233 high-risk, 88 medium-risk pages

**Critical Finding:** 45% of wiki pages (233/518) are rated as "high risk" for hallucinations, primarily due to lack of human review, low quality scores, and missing citations.

## ISSUE 1: Broken EntityLinks (470 Instances)

### Overview
The wiki contains **470 broken references** to entity IDs that do not exist in the data/entities/ directory. These appear as:
```
<EntityLink id="E102" />
<EntityLink id="E105" />
<EntityLink id="E113" />
... (467 more)
```

### Impact
- **User experience**: Broken links on published pages
- **Data integrity**: Pages reference non-existent entities
- **SEO/crawlability**: Dead internal links

### Root Cause
Entity IDs appear to be numeric placeholders (E102, E105, etc.) that were never created or were deleted without updating page references.

### Sample Broken IDs Found
```
E13, E16, E102, E105, E108, E113, E114, E116-E119,
E124-E127, E133, E136-E142, E145, E149, E151, E153-E157
```

### Examples from Pages
- `anthropic-investors.mdx` - Multiple broken E-prefixed IDs
- `anthropic-pre-ipo-daf-transfers.mdx` - References non-existent entities
- Various person and organization pages

### Remediation
- Audit data/entities/ to see if referenced entities should exist
- Remove broken EntityLinks from pages if entities don't exist
- Or create missing entities if they're genuinely needed

---

## ISSUE 2: Pages with Quality Rating 0 (54 Pages)

### Overview
54 pages have a `quality: 0` rating in frontmatter, indicating they have not been quality-assessed or graded by the system.

### Critical Pages Affected
- `anthropic.mdx` (3,277 words, 0 citations)
- `community-building-overview.mdx` (331 words, 0 citations)
- `ea-funding-absorption-capacity.mdx` (1,964 words, 3 citations)
- And 51 others

### Impact
- Pages lack quality assurance signals
- No validation that content meets project standards
- These are typically among the most complex, high-stakes pages

### Why This Matters
The hallucination risk assessment shows that pages with `quality: 0` have:
- 93% rate of "low-rigor-score" risk factor
- Average 0 citations (completely unsourced)
- 100% lack human review

### Remediation Priority: CRITICAL
These 54 pages should be:
1. Reviewed by domain experts
2. Properly sourced and cited
3. Graded using the project's quality scoring system
4. Marked as human-reviewed once verified

---

## ISSUE 3: Pages with Zero Citations (203 Pages)

### Hallucination Risk Profile
From the automated assessment:
- **Total pages with zero citations:** 203 (39% of wiki)
- **High-risk pages with no citations:** 201 (86% of high-risk pages)
- **Average word count of zero-citation pages:** ~2,500 words

### Most Critical (High Risk + No Citations + No Quality)
These represent the highest hallucination risk:

| Page | Words | Quality | Risk |
|------|-------|---------|------|
| deep-learning-era | 3,097 | 44 | 100 |
| early-warnings | 2,650 | 31 | 100 |
| miri-era | 4,136 | 31 | 100 |
| 80000-hours | 3,830 | 45 | 100 |
| ai-futures-project | 2,411 | 50 | 100 |

### Root Cause
Pages were generated by the Crux pipeline (`pnpm crux content create/improve`) but:
- LLM citation generation failed or was incomplete
- Content was not properly sourced after generation
- No citation review before publishing

### Remediation
For each page with zero citations:
1. Read the full content
2. Identify verifiable claims
3. Add citations using footnote format: `[^source]`
4. Add footnote references at bottom: `[^source]: [Title](URL)`

---

## ISSUE 4: Missing Description Fields (53 Pages)

### Overview
53 pages lack a `description:` field in their YAML frontmatter.

### Example Pages
- Multiple high-risk organization pages
- History pages
- Some response pages

### Impact
- No summary text for SEO/preview
- Incomplete page metadata
- May affect dashboard and navigation rendering

### Remediation
Add description fields:
```yaml
description: "One-sentence summary of what this page covers, optimized for search"
```

---

## ISSUE 5: Hallucination Risk Distribution

### Summary Stats
```
Total pages assessed: 518
High risk:    233 (45%)   ⚠ CRITICAL
Medium risk:   88 (17%)   ⚠ WATCH

- no-human-review:        233 (100% of high-risk)
- low-rigor-score:        216 (93% of high-risk)
- no-citations:           201 (86% of high-risk)
- few-external-sources:   197 (85% of high-risk)
- biographical-claims:     92 (39% of high-risk)
```

### Entity Types Most at Risk
1. **response** (73 high-risk)
2. **organization** (54 high-risk)
3. **model** (36 high-risk)

## ISSUE 6: Specific Factual Claims Needing Verification

### From anthropic.mdx
- **Claim:** "Claude Code's run-rate revenue exceeded $2.5 billion as of February 2026"
  - **Status:** Highly specific, needs verification from official sources
  - **Risk:** Could be hallucination or outdated data

- **Claim:** "42% enterprise coding market share" (appears multiple times)
  - **Inconsistency:** Also mentions "41% of the enterprise market share"
  - **Status:** Conflicting percentages in same page

- **Claim:** "first documented case of a foreign government using AI to fully automate a cyber operation"
  - **Status:** Extraordinary claim, needs verification
  - **Source:** References to Anthropic announcements

### From deep-learning-era.mdx
- **ImageNet performance claim:** "ImageNet error: 26% → 3.5% (2012-2017)"
  - **Status:** AlexNet achieved 15.3% error (2012), needs historical verification
  - **Concern:** Unclear if this is a misquote or different metric

### From 80000-hours.mdx
- **Foundational claim:** "Founded in 2011 by Benjamin Todd and William MacAskill"
  - **Citation status:** 0 citations in entire page despite biographical claims
  - **Risk:** No sources for founding narrative

---

## ISSUE 7: Outdated "As Of" Temporal Claims (32 Pages)

### Problem
32 pages contain outdated temporal references like "as of 2023" or "as of 2024" when the wiki is dated February 2026.

### Examples
- Pages using "as of 2024" for statistics that should be 2025/2026
- Historical sections that never update their reference frames

### Impact
Readers may assume data is current when it's actually 1-2 years stale.

---

## ISSUE 8: Patterns in High-Risk Pages

### Common Risk Factors (High-Risk Pages)
All high-risk pages share:
1. **No human review** (100%)
2. **Low rigor score** (93%)
3. **Few/no citations** (86%)
4. **Few external sources** (85%)

**Insight:** High-risk status is driven more by **process issues** (no review, no sourcing) than by content quality itself. This suggests the pages may be structurally sound but lack validation.

### Organizational Pages (54 high-risk)
- Typically organization overviews and profiles
- Often generated by Crux pipeline with minimal citations
- Biographical claims (39% of high-risk pages have these)

### Response Pages (73 high-risk)
- Short-form responses to questions
- Often lack citations by nature of format
- May be lower priority than full wiki pages

---

## Summary of Errors by Severity

### CRITICAL
- 470 broken EntityLinks (affects page rendering)
- 54 pages with quality: 0 (completely ungraded)
- 203 pages with 0 citations (completely unsourced)

### HIGH
- 53 pages missing descriptions (metadata incomplete)
- 233 pages marked high-risk for hallucinations
- Conflicting claims in major pages (anthropic.mdx)

### MEDIUM
- 32 pages with outdated temporal references
- Uncertain historical claims (deep-learning-era)
- Biographical claims lacking sources

### RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Fix broken EntityLinks:** Either create missing entities or remove broken references
2. **Review quality: 0 pages:** Grade and validate these 54 pages
3. **Add missing descriptions:** Fill in 53 blank description fields

#### Short-term (Month 1)
1. **Citation audit:** Review all 203 zero-citation pages and add sources
2. **Factual verification:** Spot-check high-risk organization and history pages
3. **Temporal update:** Fix outdated "as of" claims

#### Long-term (Ongoing)
1. **Improve Crux pipeline:** Ensure generated pages include citations
2. **Implement review gates:** Require human review before publishing high-risk pages
3. **Citation coverage:** Target minimum citations for pages >2000 words
