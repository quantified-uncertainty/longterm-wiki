- **Always include the `checks:` field** — run `pnpm crux agent-checklist snapshot` immediately before creating the session log and paste the output verbatim. This captures the checklist state at ship time as a machine-readable audit trail. The `initiated_at` timestamp reveals whether the checklist was initialized at session start (good) or created at the last minute (red flag). If no checklist was used, the command outputs `checks: {initialized: false}` — include that too, honestly. A missing `checks:` field generates a validation warning.
- **Format is machine-parsed**: The `date`, `branch`, `title`, `pages`, `pr`, `model`, `duration`, and `cost` fields are parsed by `apps/web/scripts/lib/session-log-parser.mjs` to build the `/internal/page-changes` dashboard. Validated by Zod schema in `crux/validate/validate-session-logs.ts`.
