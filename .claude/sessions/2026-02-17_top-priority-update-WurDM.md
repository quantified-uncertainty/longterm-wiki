## 2026-02-17 | claude/top-priority-update-WurDM | Update top-priority wiki page

**What was done:** Updated the "AI-Enabled Untraceable Misuse" wiki page, which was the #1 priority on the Update Schedule (priority 7.08, 49 weeks overdue). Used the Crux content improve pipeline at standard tier to add new sections on attribution successes, legal/regulatory landscape, tradeoffs/limitations, and emerging approaches. Quality score improved from 35 to 88.

**Pages:** ai-enabled-untraceable-misuse

**PR:** #188

**Issues encountered:**
- Initially worked on wrong task (entityType migration from crux/TODO.md) before user clarified they meant wiki content updates
- Research phase JSON parsing warning (non-fatal, pipeline continued successfully)

**Learnings/notes:**
- "Top of the list of next updates" refers to the Update Schedule page ranking wiki pages by staleness-weighted importance, not the crux/TODO.md code refactoring list
