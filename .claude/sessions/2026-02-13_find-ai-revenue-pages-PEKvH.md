## 2026-02-13 | claude/find-ai-revenue-pages-PEKvH | Investigate LLM crawlability of longtermwiki.com

**What was done:** Investigated why LLMs can't find longtermwiki.com pages via web search. Found the site already has comprehensive llms.txt infrastructure (llms.txt, llms-core.txt, llms-full.txt, per-page .txt files) generated by build-data.mjs. Added `LLMs-Txt` directive to robots.txt. Identified relevant AI revenue pages (ai-revenue-sources, projecting-compute-spending, anthropic-valuation, economic-disruption, etc.). Root cause is likely low domain authority/backlinks rather than technical SEO issues.

**Issues encountered:**
- pnpm install fails on puppeteer postinstall (network issue), but `--ignore-scripts` works fine
- build-data.mjs must be run from app/ directory (uses process.cwd() for path resolution)

**Learnings/notes:**
- The llms.txt system is already well-implemented — files are generated during build and served from public/
- llms*.txt files are gitignored (generated at build time), which is correct since Vercel runs build-data.mjs
- The site's main discoverability issue is search engine indexing, not technical configuration — recommend submitting sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
