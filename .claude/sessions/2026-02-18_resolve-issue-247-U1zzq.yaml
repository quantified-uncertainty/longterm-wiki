title: Fix CauseEffectGraph silent layout failure
model: opus-4-6
duration: ~15min
pages: []
summary: Fixed CauseEffectGraph layout failure handling so the UI no longer gets stuck on "Computing layout..." indefinitely. Added a 10-second timeout, improved error banner styling with proper CSS, and added a retry button.
learnings:
  - The component already had basic error handling (catch block, layoutError state), but lacked a timeout for hung computations and had poor error UX (inline styles, no retry option).
