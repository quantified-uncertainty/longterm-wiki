title: Refactor fact system to knowledge-graph measures
pages: []
summary: |-
  Redesigned the fact system with three layers of improvement:
  1. **Measures** — renamed from "metrics" to avoid collision with entity type. Rich metadata: direction, display format, relatedMeasures, applicableTo.
  2. **Auto-inference** — facts auto-infer their measure from ID (e.g., `valuation-nov-2025` → `valuation`). Use `measure: ~` to opt out.
  3. **Structured values** — fact values can now be numbers (`380e9`), ranges (`[20e9, 26e9]`), or lower bounds (`{min: 67e9}`) instead of just strings. Build pipeline auto-derives display strings, numeric, low/high from the measure context.

  Also added `subject` field for benchmark facts, source URLs, and updated the dashboard.
  4. **PR review fixes** — renamed `fact-metrics.yaml` → `fact-measures.yaml` for naming consistency, fixed `formatCompact()` percentage detection bug (false positive on `n < 1`), aligned dashboard formatting with build-time formatting.
issues:
  - Naming collision between `metric` (entity type) and `metric` (fact field) — resolved by renaming to `measure`
  - "Auto-inference was too aggressive for `revenue-yoy-growth-2024` (matched `revenue-` prefix) — fixed with `measure: ~` opt-out"
  - "`formatCompact()` in FactDashboard falsely detected any value < 1 as a percentage — fixed by removing heuristic and using measure context instead"
  - Source YAML file was still named `fact-metrics.yaml` despite the rename to "measures" — renamed to `fact-measures.yaml`
learnings:
  - 'Structured values: `value: 380e9` + measure `unit: USD` → auto-formatted as `"$380 billion"`'
  - 'Percentages: `value: 40` + measure `unit: percent` → `"40%"`, stored as `numeric: 0.4` for computation'
  - 'Ranges: `value: [20e9, 26e9]` → `"$20-26 billion"`, auto-sets low/high/numeric'
  - 'Lower bounds: `value: {min: 67e9}` → `"$67 billion+"`, handles the "+" suffix semantically'
  - 20 measures, 16 auto-inferred, 32 structured values normalized, 31 timeseries observations
  - Dashboard formatting functions (`formatWithMeasure`, `formatCompact`) must be kept aligned with build-time formatters (`formatFactNumber`, `formatFactRange`)
