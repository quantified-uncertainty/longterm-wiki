summary: |
  Fixed two of three wiki-server schema/validation issues from #492:
  1. Raised authors array max from 100 to 1000 in resource batch endpoint
     to support large collaborative papers
  2. Normalized newPagesCreated format in seed script from comma-separated
     to JSON.stringify(), matching the route handler. Added legacy format
     fallback with trim() in the GET handler.
  Note: citationContent phantom columns (issue 1) were already fixed in
  prior PR ccfecf1.

key_decisions:
  - "Authors limit set to 1000 (not unlimited) to maintain reasonable payload size limits"
  - "Added legacy comma-separated fallback in GET handler for backward compatibility with existing seeded data"
  - "Added .trim() to legacy parser per paranoid review finding"
