## 2026-02-18 | claude/issue-294-HfAfF | Reduce auto-rebase aggressiveness

**What was done:** Updated `.github/workflows/auto-rebase.yml` to avoid disrupting active Claude Code agent sessions: switched trigger from every-push-to-main to a 4-hour schedule (+ manual dispatch), added four safeguards (skip `claude-working`-labeled PRs, skip PRs/branches updated in the last 30 min, skip branches whose tip was pushed in the last 30 min, skip branches whose last commit is from ci-autofix), and added `issues: read` permission for label queries.

**Pages:** (none — infrastructure only)

**Model:** sonnet-4

**Duration:** ~15min

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Learnings/notes:**
- `gh pr list --json` supports `labels` and `updatedAt` fields; the branch tip push time is more reliable than PR updatedAt, so both checks are applied.
- The `date -d` flag works on GNU/Linux (Actions runners); macOS-style `-j -f` fallback included for portability.
