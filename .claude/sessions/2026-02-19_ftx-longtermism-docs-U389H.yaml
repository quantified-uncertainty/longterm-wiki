title: Add FTX era pages — Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, FTX Future Fund
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
duration: ~55 min
cost: ~$15 (3 pages × $5 pipeline each)
pr: https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/longterm-wiki/pull/336

pages:
  created:
    - knowledge-base/people/sam-bankman-fried
    - knowledge-base/organizations/ftx
    - knowledge-base/organizations/ftx-future-fund

summary: |
  Created three new wiki pages covering the FTX era's impact on longtermism
  and AI safety funding. All pages generated via crux content pipeline at
  standard tier. Added YAML entity definitions (E855-E860) for the new pages
  and three existing entities whose IDs shifted. Fixed tilde-dollar escaping
  in the FTX Future Fund page.

decisions:
  - "**Pages chosen**: Selected Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, and FTX Future Fund as
    the three most critical gaps — direct actors in the FTX collapse with no
    existing dedicated pages."
  - "**ID stability**: Fixed ID drift for ea-shareholder-diversification-anthropic
    (E858), state-capacity-ai-governance (E859), recoding-america (E860) by
    adding explicit numericIds to their YAML entity definitions rather than
    MDX frontmatter (since they had YAML entities)."
  - "**Tier**: Used standard tier (~$5 each) for all three pages given the
    historical significance and research depth needed."
