summary: >
  Dramatically improved 9 FTX/EA wiki pages using the crux content pipeline.
  The lowest-quality page (ftx-collapse-ea-funding-lessons, quality 3) was expanded
  from ~50 lines to 415+ lines using --tier=deep adversarial review. Eight other
  pages were improved using --tier=standard. Also fixed pre-existing numeric ID
  conflicts (E851-E853 reassignment errors in concepts.yaml/responses.yaml) and
  EntityLink ID mismatches across 10 files (E861-E866 mapped to wrong entities).
  Post-improvement paranoid review found and fixed critical factual errors:
  SBF "Harvard students" → "MIT students", outdated sentencing claims for Ellison/Wang,
  wrong FTX Future Fund resignation signatories. Also fixed 11 missing footnotes
  ([^36] truncated, [^37]-[^46] undefined) in ftx-collapse-ea-funding-lessons.mdx.

key_decisions:
  - "Used --tier=deep for ftx-collapse-ea-funding-lessons (quality 3) for adversarial multi-pass improvement"
  - "Used --tier=standard for 8 other pages to balance quality/cost"
  - "Fixed numeric ID conflicts by correcting numericId values in YAML entity files rather than using --allow-id-reassignment"
  - "Verified FTX Future Fund signatories via EA Forum web fetch before updating ftx-future-fund.mdx"
  - "Added inline 'Note: URL to be verified' caveats for unverifiable footnote URLs rather than omitting them"
  - "Quality scores updated in frontmatter to reflect post-improvement quality (e.g., ftx-collapse-ea-funding-lessons: 3→78)"
