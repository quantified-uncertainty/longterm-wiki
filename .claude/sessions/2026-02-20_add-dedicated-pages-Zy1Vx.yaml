title: "Add dedicated pages for Nick Beckstead, Will MacAskill, and Giving What We Can"
pr: https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/longterm-wiki/pull/339
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
duration: ~35min
cost: ~$15

pages:
  - nick-beckstead
  - will-macaskill
  - giving-what-we-can

summary: >
  Created three new dedicated wiki pages using the crux content pipeline (standard tier):
  Nick Beckstead (philosopher, longtermist, Secure AI Project founder),
  Will MacAskill (EA co-founder, Oxford philosopher, "What We Owe the Future" author),
  and Giving What We Can (EA org promoting the 10% pledge, founded 2009).
  Also added entity definitions (E861/E862/E863) to people.yaml and organizations.yaml.
  Fixed a pre-existing numeric ID registry conflict (E858/E859/E860 for
  ea-shareholder-diversification-anthropic, state-capacity-ai-governance, recoding-america
  which had been displaced by the newly added epstein-ai-connections page at E851).

key_decisions:
  - "Used crux content pipeline (standard tier ~$5 each) for all three pages rather than manual authoring"
  - "Fixed pre-existing ID registry conflict by running build-data --allow-id-reassignment to update id-registry.json"
  - "Added entity definitions before creating pages to enable proper EntityLink resolution"
