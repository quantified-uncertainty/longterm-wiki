title: Convert cruft files to GitHub issues
model: sonnet-4-6
duration: ~20min
pages: []
summary: Audited 6 cruft files at the repo root and in crux/TODO.md. Created 11 GitHub issues from still-actionable findings, added XS/S/M/L/XL size labels to the repo, then deleted the source files (AUDIT-REPORT.md, AUDIT-EXECUTION-SUMMARY.md, CODE-REVIEW.md, DEAD-CODE-REPORT.md, STARLIGHT-CLEANUP-PLAN.md, crux/TODO.md).
issues:
  - gh CLI not available; used GitHub REST API via curl
  - Many items in the cruft files were already resolved — checked before creating issues to avoid duplicates
learnings:
  - DEAD-CODE-REPORT items mostly already cleaned up (orphaned files gone, master-graph-data.ts down from ~1400 to 97 lines)
  - STARLIGHT-CLEANUP-PLAN mostly done — only 15 files still have pageTemplate frontmatter
  - "CODE-REVIEW #1 (withRetry) and #3 (frontmatter-scanner directories) already fixed"
  - crux/TODO.md items 1-5 all done, only item 6 remained (entityType migration)
