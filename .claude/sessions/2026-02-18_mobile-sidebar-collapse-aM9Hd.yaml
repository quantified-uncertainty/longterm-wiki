title: Mobile sidebar collapse
model: opus-4-6
duration: ~20min
pages: []
summary: Added mobile sidebar support — on screens below 768px, the static sidebar is hidden and replaced with a hamburger trigger button that opens a slide-out overlay panel with smooth transitions. Auto-closes on route navigation, Escape key, and backdrop click.
learnings:
  - "`SidebarTrigger` component existed but was never used — created separate `MobileSidebar` and `MobileSidebarTrigger` components with dedicated mobile context to avoid coupling desktop and mobile state"
  - No Sheet/Dialog radix primitive was installed, so built the overlay with plain CSS transitions (opacity + transform) to avoid adding dependencies
