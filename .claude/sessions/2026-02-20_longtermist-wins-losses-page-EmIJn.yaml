summary: >
  Created a comprehensive 350-line wiki page tracking EA and longtermist wins and losses,
  broken down by year and topic (2006–2025), with cumulative organization statistics,
  a Notable Policy Record table, counterfactual attribution analysis, and documented
  wins/losses across global health, AI safety, animal welfare, and community building.
  Used crux content create (premium tier) followed by crux content improve (deep tier,
  2 adversarial iterations, ~58 research sources). Fixed multiple rounds of numeric ID
  stability issues affecting existing YAML entities. Fixed file truncation after improve
  pipeline. Completed paranoid review and corrected: Anthropic founding year (2022→2021),
  GiveWell $1.45B wrong citation, duplicate/orphaned footnotes, FTX dollar inconsistency
  ($130M→$160M), MIRI pivot year (2023→2024 in table), Nathan Robinson article date (2022→2023),
  GiveWell founding year (2007→2006), AMF grant figure ($97M→$96.3M). Pinned numericId: E868
  in frontmatter to prevent future ID stability issues.

key_decisions:
  - "Used crux content create (premium) + crux content improve (deep, 2 iterations) pipeline"
  - "Fixed numeric ID stability failures caused by YAML entities with stale id-registry.json"
  - "Fixed file truncation by appending missing footnotes [^29]-[^53] from intermediate pipeline file"
  - "Ran paranoid review to identify and fix 4 critical + 8 warning factual issues"
  - "Pinned numericId in ftx-red-flags frontmatter to prevent page ID shift from E865→E864"

issues:
  - "crux content improve output was truncated mid-footnote; fixed by manual append from intermediate file"
  - "YAML entity numericIds were out of sync with id-registry.json; resolved with --allow-id-reassignment"
  - "Deleted draft page ea-and-longtermist-wins-and-losses.mdx caused ftx-red-flags to shift from E865→E864; fixed by pinning E865 in frontmatter"
