title: Add concrete shareable data tables to high-value pages
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~45min
pages:
  - openai
  - safety-orgs-overview
  - ai-talent-market-dynamics
summary: >
  Added three concrete, screenshot-worthy data tables to high-value wiki pages: (1) OpenAI ownership/stakeholder table to openai.mdx showing the 2024-2025 PBC restructuring with Foundation ~26%, Microsoft transitioning from 49% profit share to ~2.5% equity, and Sam Altman's proposed 7% grant; (2) Budget and headcount comparison table to safety-orgs-overview.mdx covering MIRI, ARC, METR, Redwood Research, CAIS, Apollo Research, GovAI, Conjecture, and FAR AI with annual budgets, headcounts, and cost-per-researcher; (3) Per-company compensation comparison table to ai-talent-market-dynamics.mdx comparing Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, xAI, Meta AI, and Microsoft Research by total comp range, base salary, equity type, and benefits including Anthropic's unique DAF matching program.
issues:
  - Some ownership figures for OpenAI are based on reported/estimated numbers and remain subject to final regulatory review
  - pipeline added NEEDS CITATION comments for some figures that need future verification
learnings:
  - The crux improve pipeline with --directions is very effective at adding targeted tables to existing pages
  - Safety org budget data is hard to pin down precisely; 990 filings lag by 1-2 years
recommendations:
  - Consider creating a dedicated OpenAI stakeholders page similar to anthropic-stakeholders.mdx once the restructuring is finalized
  - The safety-orgs budget table would benefit from linking to individual org 990 filings as citations
