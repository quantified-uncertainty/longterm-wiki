summary: Audited ~20 recently merged PRs for bugs and code quality issues. Found and fixed 8 distinct bugs across multiple PRs including broken page links, unused imports, graph sync failures, unescaped dollar signs, missing error handling, and a validator that couldn't handle numeric entity IDs.
pr: 138
issues:
  - "PR #121 (page changes dashboard) had broken links to internal pages — used `/wiki/` prefix for pages that live under `/internal/`"
  - Legacy data validator (`validate-data.ts`) did not understand numeric entity IDs (E5, E11, etc.) introduced by the EntityLink ID migration, causing 213 false positive errors
  - "PR #133 (EA shareholder diversification) had unescaped `$` signs in frontmatter description and llmSummary fields"
  - Graph node sync was broken because master graph used `ai-governance` while entity files used `tmc-ai-governance`
  - 6 MDX files had orphaned `PageCauseEffectGraph` imports after Related Pages cleanup
  - Search dialog had no error handling for failed search index loads
  - Multiple internal link pages were missing trailing slashes
learnings:
  - When numeric entity IDs are introduced, all validators that check entity references need to be updated — both the legacy subprocess validators and the unified rule engine
  - The `component-refs` unified rule still reports warnings for unused imports and DataInfoBox refs that are actually non-blocking (they don't prevent builds or rendering)
