title: Move discord-bot into apps/
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~10min
pages: []
summary: Moved `discord-bot/` → `apps/discord-bot/` and updated `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Fixed `WIKI_ROOT` path comment in `config.ts` (the `../../..` resolve was already correct for the new depth, but the comment was wrong).
issues:
  - "`git mv` failed with cross-device link error; used `cp -r` + `git rm` + `git add` instead"
learnings:
  - After the move, `resolve(__dirname, "../../..")` from `apps/discord-bot/src/` now correctly reaches the repo root (was one level too far before)
  - Filed issue for the full `app/` → `apps/web/` rename
