title: Migrate existing pages to declare entityType in frontmatter
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~15min
pages:
  - recoding-america
  - state-capacity-ai-governance
summary: >
  Added entityType: approach to the 2 remaining MDX pages in the responses category that
  were missing it (recoding-america.mdx and state-capacity-ai-governance.mdx). The migration
  script (crux/scripts/migrate-entity-types.mjs) already existed and was run to apply the changes.
issues:
  - The issue description said ~600 existing pages still needed migration, but nearly all had already been done in prior sessions. Only 2 non-index pages remained.
  - The 7 index.mdx files in entity-required categories correctly remain without entityType (they're directory listings, not entities).
learnings:
  - The migration script at crux/scripts/migrate-entity-types.mjs skips index.mdx files, which is correct.
  - YAML entities (state-capacity-ai-governance type=concept, recoding-america type=resource) take precedence over the frontmatter entityType per build-data.mjs logic — the frontmatter addition is safe and additive.
