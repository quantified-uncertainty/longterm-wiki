## 2026-02-18 | claude/fix-issue-240-N5irU | Add tacticalValue metric for concrete shareable content

**What was done:** Added `tacticalValue` (0–100) frontmatter field to recognize concrete, shareable content like tables and factual compilations that are undervalued by `readerImportance` alone. Wired it into the frontmatter schema, data layer, update schedule priority formula (tactical value boosts priority when higher than reader importance), and the importance-rankings dashboard. Scored four high-tactical-value pages.

**Pages:** anthropic-investors, anthropic-stakeholders, frontier-ai-comparison, dustin-moskovitz

**Model:** sonnet-4

**Duration:** ~30min

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Learnings/notes:**
- The update schedule formula now uses `effectiveImportance = tv > readerImp ? (readerImp + tv) / 2 : readerImp` — tactical value can only boost, never reduce, update priority.
- `getPageRankings()` filter still requires readerImportance or researchImportance; pages with only tacticalValue won't appear in the rankings table (acceptable for now since all scored pages have readerImportance set).
