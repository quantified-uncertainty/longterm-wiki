## 2026-02-18 | claude/fix-issue-240-N5irU | Surface tacticalValue in /wiki table and score 53 pages

**What was done:** Added `tacticalValue` to `ExploreItem` interface, `getExploreItems()` mappings, the `/wiki` explore table (new sortable "Tact." column), and the card view sort dropdown. Scored 49 new pages with tactical values (4 were already scored), bringing total to 53.

**Pages:** openai-foundation, microsoft, frontier-model-forum, metr, cais, funders-overview, palisade-research, epistemic-orgs-epoch-ai, rethink-priorities, seldon-lab, goodfire, far-ai, pause-ai, ai-impacts, epistemic-orgs-overview, venture-capital-overview, center-for-applied-rationality, ai-futures-project, secure-ai-project, hewlett-foundation, leading-the-future, safety-orgs-epoch-ai, dan-hendrycks, eliezer-yudkowsky, neel-nanda, jan-leike, nick-bostrom, max-tegmark, nuno-sempere, agentic-ai, language-models, reasoning, situational-awareness, tool-use, large-language-models, ai-timelines, scaling-laws, transformative-ai, alignment-progress, export-controls, ai-governance, compute, capabilities, expert-opinion, agi-timeline-debate, is-ai-xrisk-real, why-alignment-hard, alignment, existential-risk

**Model:** sonnet-4

**Duration:** ~30min

**Issues encountered:**
- TypeScript error: diagram items mapping in getExploreItems() was missing tacticalValue: null — fixed
- First push rejected (remote had newer commits), resolved with fetch + rebase

**Learnings/notes:**
- ExploreItem has three construction sites in getExploreItems(): entity items, page-only items, and diagram items — all three need updating when adding a new field
