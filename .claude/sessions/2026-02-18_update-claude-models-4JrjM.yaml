title: Citation verification system + hallucination risk infrastructure
pages: []
summary: "Built a full citation verification and archival system (`crux citations`) with SQLite-backed deep content storage. Implemented hallucination risk assessment, human review tracking, and citation validation rules. Polished error handling, output formatting, and code documentation across the citation system. Created GitHub issues #219-#221 for the follow-up work (backfill, Postgres sync, K8s CronJob)."
learnings:
  - Models were already at claude-sonnet-4-6 and claude-opus-4-6; only the verification date needed updating
  - The hallucination risk report found 233 high-risk pages, with 201 having zero citations
  - Citation density rule produces 244 warnings across knowledge-base pages
  - "Citation archive system tested on sleeper-agents page: all 13 citations verified successfully with full metadata"
  - Many pages use plain-text footnotes (book/journal references) without URLs — the citation verifier only processes URL-based footnotes
  - "Next steps tracked in issues #219 (backfill), #220 (Postgres sync), #221 (K8s CronJob)"
