title: Add live-data-test item to agent-checklist
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~15min
pages: []
summary: >
  Added a new "Tested on live data" checklist item (id: live-data-test) to the
  agent-checklist review phase, applicable to infrastructure, commands, bugfix,
  and refactor session types. Also updated the test suite accordingly.
issues:
  - The existing "content type has more items than infrastructure" test had to be
    relaxed to >=, since the new non-content item made the counts equal.
learnings:
  - The count-based item test in session-checklist.test.ts is brittle to new
    items being added; ID-specific tests are more durable.
