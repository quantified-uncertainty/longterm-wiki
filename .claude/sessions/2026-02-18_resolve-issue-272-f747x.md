## 2026-02-18 | claude/resolve-issue-272-f747x | Add /internal/github-issues dashboard

**What was done:** Created a new internal dashboard at `/internal/github-issues` that shows live GitHub issue data — in-progress issues (with `claude-working` label) and a priority queue (top 20, ranked P0–P3 + age). Added nav entry under "Dashboards & Tools".

**Pages:** (no wiki pages — infrastructure only)

**Model:** sonnet-4

**Duration:** ~20min

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Learnings/notes:**
- Server components can use `next: { revalidate: 60 }` in fetch options for short-lived caching of live API data
- The `priorityLabel` field was initially included in the row type but was unused — removed in review
