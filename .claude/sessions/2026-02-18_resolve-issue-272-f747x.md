## 2026-02-18 | claude/resolve-issue-272-f747x | Add /internal/github-issues dashboard

**What was done:** Created a new internal dashboard at `/internal/github-issues` that shows live GitHub issue data — in-progress issues (with `claude-working` label) and a priority queue (top 20, ranked P0–P3 + age). Added nav entry under "Dashboards & Tools".

**Pages:** (no wiki pages — infrastructure only)

**Model:** sonnet-4

**Duration:** ~1h (includes paranoid review pass + fixes)

**Issues encountered:**
- EXA_API_KEY was not wired into auto-update.yml — Exa would never run in CI
- EXA_API_KEY captured at module load time in feed-fetcher.ts — fixed to read at call time
- IssueRow type imported from page.tsx into issues-table.tsx (circular smell) — extracted to types.ts
- sync:data/prebuild missing NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 — added for consistency
- auto-update/**/*.test.ts not in vitest.config.ts include list — fixed
- Conflict on rebase: remote added assign-ids script to sync:data/prebuild; merged both changes
- Gate check failed when run from app/ subdirectory (not a real bug, operator error)

**Learnings/notes:**
- Server components can use `next: { revalidate: 60 }` in fetch options for short-lived caching of live API data
- The `priorityLabel` field was initially included in the row type but was unused — removed in review
- `crux/vitest.config.ts` only includes specific directories — new test dirs must be added explicitly
- Always read env vars at call time, not module load time, to keep tests mockable
- Created GitHub issue #283 (GITHUB_TOKEN deployment) and #285 (pagination >100 issues)
