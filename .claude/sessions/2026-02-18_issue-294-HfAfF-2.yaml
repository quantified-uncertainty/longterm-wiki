summary: "Updated PR #295 description to check off the already-satisfied CI lint item and annotate remaining test plan items as human-action-required. Updated `anthropic-stakeholders.mdx` frontmatter: raised `readerImportance` and `researchImportance` to 85, set `update_frequency` to 14 days. Ran full gate check (7/7 passed). Marked issue #294 done."
pr: 295
issues:
  - "`pnpm crux issues done` does not accept `--pr=URL` argument (flag silently rejected with usage error); had to run without the flag."
learnings:
  - The wip-checklist from a prior session was already 27/27 — the checklist system doesn't distinguish between sessions on the same branch.
  - Test plan items requiring `workflow_dispatch` and scheduled-run observation are genuinely human-only; worth marking them explicitly in the PR body rather than leaving them ambiguously unchecked.
