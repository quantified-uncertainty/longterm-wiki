title: Add sidebar navigation for browse, guides, project, and insight-hunting sections
issue: 382
pr: https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/longterm-wiki/pull/403
model: claude-opus-4-6
pages: []
duration: ~20min
cost: ~$5

summary: |
  Added sidebar navigation to 4 top-level sections (browse, guides, project, insight-hunting)
  that were navigational dead ends with ~16 pages having no way to discover related pages.
  Extended the existing data-driven sidebar system with a new "section" type that reuses
  buildSectionNav(). Also fixed buildSectionNav to skip the Overview link when no index page
  exists (prevents broken links for guides section).

key_decisions:
  - Added generic "section" sidebar type — reuses existing buildSectionNav() to avoid duplication
  - Skip Overview link when no index page exists — guides section has no index.mdx
  - Made extractSection and getSectionNav non-exported after paranoid review identified latent misuse risk
  - Pre-existing ID reassignment (ftx-collapse / longtermism-credibility) resolved with --allow-id-reassignment
