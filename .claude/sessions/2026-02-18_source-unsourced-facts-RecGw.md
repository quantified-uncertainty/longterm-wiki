## 2026-02-18 | claude/source-unsourced-facts-RecGw | Source unsourced facts

**What was done:** Sourced 25 of 30 previously unsourced facts across all 4 fact files (anthropic, sam-altman, openai, jaan-tallinn). Created 21 new resource entries in news-media.yaml and ai-labs.yaml with proper SHA256-based IDs. Added 8 new publications (Bloomberg, The Information, Quartz, Benzinga, Britannica, World, Sherwood News). Fixed date accuracy issues (Worldcoin stats from 2024 to 2025-05, OpenAI revenue from Oct to Jun 2024) and improved notes. Source coverage improved from 29% to 88%.

**Pages:** anthropic, sam-altman, openai, jaan-tallinn

**Model:** opus-4-6

**Duration:** ~45min

**Issues encountered:**
- 5 Anthropic facts (enterprise-retention-rate, industry-avg-retention, customer-concentration, safety-researchers, safety-pct-of-technical) could not be sourced to published material — marked as estimates with explanatory notes
- Worldcoin user counts were dated 2024 but the source data is from May 2025 — corrected
- OpenAI revenue-2024-projected was listed as Oct 2024 but the $3.4B figure is from June 2024 — corrected
- OpenAI 1,700% growth figure is not true YoY — clarified in note

**Learnings/notes:**
- Many Anthropic financial metrics (retention rates, safety staffing percentages) appear in wiki prose but lack published sources — these may have been inferred from aggregate data or internal estimates
- The Information is a key source for AI lab financials but articles are paywalled; Reuters/Yahoo Finance syndications often have the same data
