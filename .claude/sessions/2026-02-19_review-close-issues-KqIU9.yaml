title: "Fix triage-issues: use explicit closes #N instead of keyword matching"
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~20min
pages: []
summary: >
  Fixed crux maintain triage-issues to use explicit closes/fixes/resolves #N references in
  merged PR bodies as the only signal for "potentially resolved" issues. Previously it used
  60% keyword-overlap matching against PR titles and session logs, causing ~97% false positive
  rate (29/30 issues flagged). Now 0 false positives.
issues:
  - GitHubPullResponse interface was missing the body field, so PR bodies were never fetched — had to add it to the type.
  - Pre-existing TypeScript errors in other crux files (unrelated to this change) — no new errors introduced.
learnings:
  - The --since option was being parsed but only used to load session logs for keyword matching. After removing keyword matching, both became dead code and were removed from triageIssues.
  - isLikelyReferenced and tokenize helpers are now fully unused and were deleted.
