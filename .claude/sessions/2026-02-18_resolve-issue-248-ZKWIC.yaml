title: Break up oversized crux files + review fixes
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~45min
pages: []
summary: "Further split two remaining oversized modules (grading/index.ts 488 lines, link-checker/checkers.ts 463 lines) into focused sub-modules. Then did a paranoid review and fixed all issues: new TS type error in processPage (Anthropic|null→Anthropic), shim over-exports, extractFrontmatter alias, Metrics inline type, contentFormat cast, stats empty guard, check-links.ts module error, and added 38 unit tests for getCheckStrategy."
issues:
  - "`crux/tsconfig.json` is not checked by the gate's `tsc --noEmit` step (uses app tsconfig only) — 14+ pre-existing crux TypeScript errors are invisible to CI"
  - Extracting `processPage` from a closure to a top-level function introduced a new TS type error (`Anthropic|null` instead of `Anthropic`) — fixed
  - checkers.ts shim was over-exporting 4 previously-private functions — fixed
learnings:
  - When extracting closures to top-level functions, check that captured variable types (especially after `!` non-null assertions) are preserved in the new parameter signature
  - The gate's `tsc --noEmit` targets `app/tsconfig.json`, not `crux/tsconfig.json` — crux TypeScript errors are silent in CI. A follow-up issue should add crux to the gate once the 14 pre-existing errors are cleaned up.
