title: Programmatic session checklist system
model: opus-4-6
duration: ~45min
pages: []
summary: Built `crux agent-checklist init/status/complete` CLI — a typed checklist system that replaces the static checklist-template.md. Generates tailored checklists based on task type (content, infrastructure, bugfix, refactor, commands) from a 40-item catalog. Added Key Decisions logging, merge/CI verification items, and deduplicated `currentBranch()`. Renamed `/kickoff` → `/agent-session-start` and `/finalize` → `/agent-session-ready-PR`. Renamed CLI domain from "session" to "agent-checklist".
issues:
  - "`pnpm crux validate gate` fails on build-data step (pre-existing ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION for .ts imports in build-data.mjs, same on clean main)"
  - "`npx tsc --noEmit` in crux/ has many pre-existing errors (authoring, generate, rules modules); new session files compile clean"
  - Sandbox permission errors with npx (used local tsc binary instead)
learnings:
  - The gate check build-data failure is pre-existing and should be tracked as a separate issue
  - "`currentBranch()` was duplicated across issues.ts and session-checklist.ts — fixed by having issues.ts import from session-checklist.ts"
  - Checklist round-trip tests (build then parse) are valuable for catching format mismatches
