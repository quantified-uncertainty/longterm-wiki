title: Add LLM metadata to session/PR logs
model: opus-4-6
duration: ~30min
pages: []
summary: Added three new optional fields to session logs — Model, Duration, and Cost — so the page-changes dashboard and per-page change history show which LLM did the work, how long it took, and approximate cost. Updated parser, types, tests, dashboard table (new Model column), and PageStatus sidebar.
learnings:
  - The session log parser uses a simple regex pattern `**Field:**\s*(.+?)(?:\n\n|\n\*\*|\n---)` for each field, so new fields are trivial to add as long as they follow the same bold-label format
  - Existing ~70 session files gracefully degrade — new fields are undefined for old sessions, shown as "—" in the dashboard
