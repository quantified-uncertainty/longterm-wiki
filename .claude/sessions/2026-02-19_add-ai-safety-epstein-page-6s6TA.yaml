summary: >
  Created new wiki page documenting Jeffrey Epstein's financial and professional
  relationships with AI researchers and organizations (2001-2019). The page covers
  Ben Goertzel ($100k AGI grant + Humanity+ funding + Hong Kong scheme), MIT connections
  (Marvin Minsky, Joscha Bach, Seth Lloyd, Joi Ito), MIRI ($50k from COUQ Foundation
  in 2009), Nick Bostrom/Humanity+ network, Harvard PED (Martin Nowak, $6.5M directed
  / $30M pledged), the Edge Foundation, and the Arel "robotic AGI toddler" proposal.
  Page placed in content/docs/knowledge-base/history/. Used crux content pipeline for
  initial draft then manually enriched with additional research from DOJ files, MIT
  fact-finding report, Harvard OGC review, WUOT, and other sources. Paranoid subagent
  review found and fixed 15+ issues including: discipline mislabeling (Ariely = behavioral
  economist, not sociologist; Gardner = cognitive psychologist; Nowak = mathematician),
  MIT AI Lab vs Media Lab confusion for Minsky, duplicate $120k donation citation,
  chronological inconsistency in Harvard PED section, "largest grant" label inaccuracy,
  and unused import dead code. All 7 gate checks pass.
issues:
  - Paranoid review subagent called `crux agent-checklist init` internally, which
    overwrote wip-checklist.md with a fresh infrastructure checklist. Manually restored
    the content checklist by rewriting the file.
  - Byline Times source (fn8, Dec 2025) pre-dates DOJ file release (Jan 2026) — claims
    sourced from it may draw on earlier reporting rather than DOJ documents directly.
    Noted in page via `balanceFlags: single-source-dominance`.
learnings:
  - The crux pipeline's synthesize phase produced a solid base page but missed several
    documented connections (Bach, Lloyd, MIRI, Edge Foundation, Hong Kong scheme) that
    required manual addition.
  - For sensitive factual pages, paranoid subagent review is especially valuable — it
    caught discipline mislabelings that would have undermined reader trust.
  - Funding tables should separate confirmed grants from unconfirmed proposals to avoid
    implying parity between them.
