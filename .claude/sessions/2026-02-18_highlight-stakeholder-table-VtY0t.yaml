title: Create dedicated Anthropic stakeholder page
model: opus-4-6
duration: ~30min
pages:
  - anthropic-stakeholders
  - anthropic
summary: Created a new dedicated `anthropic-stakeholders` page with the most shareable ownership tables (all stakeholders with stakes, values, EA alignment), added a condensed stakeholder summary to the top of the main Anthropic page, and wrote 4 proposed GitHub issues for broader system changes (datasets infrastructure, importance metrics rethink, concrete data expansion, continuous maintenance).
issues:
  - GitHub CLI not installed and token expired, so issues were written as markdown files in `.claude/proposed-issues/` instead of created directly
learnings:
  - The facts system is scalar-only and cannot store tabular data — a new `data/datasets/` infrastructure is needed for cross-page table embedding
  - "The importance scoring system systematically undervalues tactical, concrete, shareable content (anthropic-investors has readerImportance: 33 despite being the most-shared content)"
  - The ATM content model has YAML-stored tables but is specialized and not general-purpose
  - "Issue #149 (closed) previously identified the cross-page data sharing gap"
