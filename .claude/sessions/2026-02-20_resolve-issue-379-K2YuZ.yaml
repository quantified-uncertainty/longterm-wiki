title: "Standardize table column headers across ~120 wiki pages"
issue: 379
pr: https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/longterm-wiki/pull/392
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
pages: []

summary: |
  Resolved issue #379 by auditing all three standard table types across the wiki,
  establishing canonical column header formats, and applying them consistently
  across 118 content pages (120 header changes total). Also added a new
  `table-headers` validation rule to crux to prevent future regressions.
  Canonical formats: Risk Assessment: | Dimension | Assessment | Notes |,
  Quick Assessment: | Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |,
  Key Links: | Source | Link |. All 8 gate checks pass (229 tests).

key_decisions:
  - "Canonical Risk Assessment header: | Dimension | Assessment | Notes | (20x most common, matches knowledge-base style guide)"
  - "Canonical Quick Assessment header: | Dimension | Assessment | Evidence | (187x most common, 55% of all QA tables)"
  - "Canonical Key Links header: | Source | Link | (157x most common, 98%)"
  - "Specialized multi-column tables (5-col risk tables, comparison tables) left as-is at info level — cannot compress without losing data"
  - "Validation rule severity: warning for auto-fixable aliases, info for specialized multi-column variants"
  - "Added table-headers validation rule to crux to enforce standards going forward"
