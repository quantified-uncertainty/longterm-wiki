title: Improve page-changes dashboard to session-grouped view
summary: >-
  Replaced the flat 347-row DataTable (one row per page-per-session) with a
  clean session-grouped layout showing 45 sessions with pages listed inside
  each. Added getPageChangeSessions() data function and PageChangesSessions
  client component with week-grouped sections, search filtering, and compact
  page chip display. Also merged main (PR #302, YAML session format migration)
  before implementing.
pages: []
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~30min
issues:
  - PR #302 (YAML session format migration) had just been merged to main —
    needed to fetch and merge before starting to ensure compliance
learnings:
  - The flat DataTable gets very noisy with many sessions; session-grouped cards
    are far easier to scan
  - getPageChangeSessions() groups by date|branch key which cleanly deduplicates
    the 347 items into 45 session records
