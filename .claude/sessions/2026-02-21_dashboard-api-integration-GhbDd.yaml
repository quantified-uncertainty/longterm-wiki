summary: |
  Converted page-changes and hallucination-risk dashboards from reading
  database.json to fetching from wiki-server API endpoints, with graceful
  fallback. Verified citation-accuracy dashboard already uses API correctly.

key_decisions:
  - "API-first with fallback: Both dashboards try wiki-server API first (5-minute cache), falling back to database.json when server is unavailable"
  - "Page metadata enrichment: API returns only page IDs; local database.json provides titles, paths, entity types for display"
  - "Pagination safety: Hallucination risk API uses for-loop with maxPages=20 guard instead of while(true)"
  - "No shared helper extracted: Auth/fetch pattern is duplicated across 4 dashboards, matching existing codebase convention"
  - "Tooling gaps: None identified — straightforward refactor"
