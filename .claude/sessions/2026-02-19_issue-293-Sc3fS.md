## 2026-02-19 | claude/issue-293-Sc3fS | Discord bot: refactor cost tracking into pricing.ts

**What was done:** Extracted the `PRICING` table from `logger.ts` into a new `pricing.ts` module. Fixed the stale `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` model ID to `claude-sonnet-4-6`, added cache-read token pricing (~10% of input), added a `console.warn` for unknown models, and updated `calculateCost` to accept an optional `cacheReadTokens` parameter. Updated `index.ts` to pass `cacheReadTokens` to `calculateCost`. Extended tests to cover cache-read pricing and the unknown-model warning.

**Pages:** (none — infrastructure-only)

**Model:** sonnet-4

**Duration:** ~20min

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Learnings/notes:**
- The existing test for "unknown model" was silent about warnings; now it explicitly asserts the `console.warn` call.
- `claude-sonnet-4-6` is the correct model ID for Sonnet 4 per the system prompt.
