    title: "Populate empty server tables + wire remaining dual-writes"
    action: fixed
key_decisions:
  - decision: "Removed resource dual-write from saveResources()"
    rationale: "Server UPSERT replaces all columns; in-memory Resource type lacks fields like review, keyPoints. Fire-and-forget upserts would overwrite valid data with nulls."
  - decision: "Batch loop DRY violation acknowledged but not refactored"
    rationale: "Pre-existing pattern across 5 sync scripts. Refactoring into generic batchSync<T>() helper is separate concern."
  - decision: "Added upsertResource() to wiki-server-client despite removing dual-write"
    rationale: "Valid client API method for future consumers; the issue was using it in saveResources() with partial data."
