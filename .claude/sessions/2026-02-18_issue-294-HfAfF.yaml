title: Reduce auto-rebase aggressiveness
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~15min

summary: "Updated `.github/workflows/auto-rebase.yml` to avoid disrupting active Claude Code agent sessions: switched trigger from every-push-to-main to a 4-hour schedule (+ manual dispatch), added four safeguards (skip `claude-working`-labeled PRs, skip PRs/branches updated in the last 30 min, skip branches whose tip was pushed in the last 30 min, skip branches whose last commit is from ci-autofix), and added `issues: read` permission for label queries."
learnings:
  - "`gh pr list --json` supports `labels` and `updatedAt` fields; the branch tip push time is more reliable than PR updatedAt, so both checks are applied."
  - The `date -d` flag works on GNU/Linux (Actions runners); macOS-style `-j -f` fallback included for portability.
