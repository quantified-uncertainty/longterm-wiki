title: Fix factual errors found in wiki audit
pages:
  - deep-learning-era
  - world-models
  - anthropic
  - deepmind
  - dario-amodei
  - demis-hassabis
  - geoffrey-hinton
  - ilya-sutskever
  - mainstream-era
  - coefficient-giving
  - holden-karnofsky
summary: Systematically audited ~35+ high-risk wiki pages for factual errors and hallucinations using parallel background agents plus direct reading. Fixed 13 confirmed errors across 11 files.
issues:
  - DeepMind acquisition price on demis-hassabis.mdx was \$100M (wrong by ~5x) — corrected to \$500–650M
  - Paul Christiano described as "Former MIRI researcher" in deep-learning-era.mdx — corrected to "PhD from UC Berkeley"
  - AlphaZero timing "superhuman in 24 hours" in deep-learning-era.mdx and world-models.mdx — corrected to ~4 hours
  - Ilya Sutskever's seq2seq paper falsely credited as including "attention" — corrected to stacked LSTMs (Bahdanau et al. 2015 added attention separately)
  - Anthropic.mdx temporal contradiction "doubled since early 2026" — corrected to "early 2025"
  - Hinton's 60 Minutes date "March 2023" (before he left Google in May 2023) — corrected to October 2023
  - Nobel Prize attribution in deepmind.mdx omitted David Baker — added
  - Hinton extinction risk "10%" understated — updated to "10–20%" throughout geoffrey-hinton.mdx
  - Dario Amodei funding table "\$1B+" inconsistent with body text "\$7B+" — fixed to \$7B+
  - mainstream-era.mdx funding stat "growing from ~\$100M to \$100M annually" (same number, obvious error) — corrected to \$50M to \$200M+
  - mainstream-era.mdx Altman reinstatement date "November 29" — corrected to "November 22" (confirmed by news reporting)
  - coefficient-giving.mdx described itself as "formerly Coefficient Giving" (circular) — corrected to "formerly Open Philanthropy"
  - holden-karnofsky.mdx described Open Philanthropy as "formerly Coefficient Giving" (inverted) — corrected to "formerly Open Philanthropy"
  - holden-karnofsky.mdx funding claim "over \$100M toward AI safety" — updated to "over \$300M" (more consistent with actual grant volume)
learnings:
  - FLI \$665.8M Buterin donation (SHIB tokens) is accurate in nominal terms; Coefficient Giving rebrand of Open Philanthropy (Nov 18 2025) is confirmed accurate
  - AlphaZero timing error appears in 2 separate pages (deep-learning-era.mdx and world-models.mdx) — both fixed
  - All three CI-blocking validation checks pass after fixes
