title: "Add quality scores to 49 unscored wiki pages and --unscored CLI flag"
issue: 362
pr: ""
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
duration: ~30min
cost: ~$0.74

summary: |
  Resolved issue #362 by grading 49 previously-unscored wiki pages using the
  crux-grade pipeline (Step 3 only, skip-warnings mode). Also improved the
  grade-content CLI by adding --unscored flag, excluding internal pages from
  grading, and fixing the passthrough list so that apply/parallel/page/limit
  options actually work when invoked via `pnpm crux content grade-content`.

key_decisions:
  - "Added --unscored flag to grade-content CLI: Filter pages without quality scores (currentQuality === null), complementing the existing --skip-graded flag which filters by readerImportance."
  - "Added internal page exclusion to default grading filter: crux content grade-content previously included internal/ pages; added p.category !== 'internal' filter."
  - "Used --skip-warnings for speed: Full 3-step pipeline ~$0.95 vs ~$0.74 step-3-only. These are mostly overview/hub pages with minimal content."
  - "Expanded grade-content passthrough list: Previously missing apply, parallel, page, limit, category, skipGraded, unscored, output — these are now properly forwarded."
  - "Tooling gaps: None identified."
