summary: Removed the legacy `pageTemplate` frontmatter field from 15 MDX files. This field was carried over from the Astro/Starlight era and is not used by the Next.js application.
learnings:
  - The `pageTemplate` field is still referenced in crux grading code (`page-templates.ts`, `grade-by-template.ts`) but those paths handle missing values gracefully via null checks, so removal from MDX is safe without code changes.
