summary: |
  Deep audit of wiki navigation and frontmatter consistency. Found and fixed
  systematic issues causing duplicate/split sidebar sections, ~130 uncategorized
  pages landing in "Other", a confusing double-named subcategory, a numericId
  conflict, and a MDX compilation error in anthropic.mdx.

changes:
  - type: fix
    description: >
      Fixed 9 pages with quoted subcategory values (subcategory: "labs",
      subcategory: "governance-legislation", subcategory: "governance") that
      created duplicate sidebar sections alongside their unquoted counterparts.
  - type: fix
    description: >
      Renamed epistemic-tools-tools → epistemic-platforms (21 pages) and
      epistemic-tools-approaches → epistemic-approaches (15 pages) to eliminate
      confusing double-"tools" name.
  - type: fix
    description: >
      Fixed lone governance subcategory in models section
      (planning-for-frontier-lab-scaling) → governance-models to merge with
      existing 7-page group.
  - type: fix
    description: >
      Added subcategories to ~130 previously uncategorized pages:
      responses (23), risks (8), organizations (4), capabilities (12),
      people (39), debates (7), intelligence-paradigms (16), history (12),
      models (5).
  - type: fix
    description: >
      Resolved numericId conflict: epstein-ai-connections.mdx was assigned E851
      which conflicted with existing YAML entity ea-shareholder-diversification-
      anthropic. Updated YAML entities to new IDs (E858/E859/E860) and ran
      --allow-id-reassignment to reconcile registry.
  - type: fix
    description: >
      Fixed MDX compilation error in anthropic.mdx: double semicolon on
      import line (import {Calc} from '@components/facts';;) that would have
      broken production build.
