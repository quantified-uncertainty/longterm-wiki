title: Remove duplicate metrics-extractor.mjs
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~10min
pages: []
summary: Deleted the now-unused `app/scripts/lib/metrics-extractor.mjs` file (372 lines) since the build script had already been migrated to import directly from `crux/lib/metrics-extractor.ts`. Updated stale inline comments in `crux/authoring/creator/grading.ts` and `crux/lib/rules/frontmatter-schema.ts`, stale references in `content/docs/internal/architecture.mdx` (Mermaid diagram + prose), and marked item 2 in `CODE-REVIEW.md` as resolved.
issues:
  - None — the migration to the TS canonical source was already done; only cleanup remained.
learnings:
  - The build script (`app/scripts/build-data.mjs`) uses `--import tsx/esm` via the `crux` workspace command, which allows it to import `.ts` files directly without a transpile step.
