title: Improve top 5 foundational wiki pages
pages:
  - existential-risk
  - superintelligence
  - agentic-ai
  - ai-timelines
  - scaling-laws
summary: Improved the 5 highest-importance, lowest-quality wiki pages using the Crux content pipeline. All were stubs (7 words) or had quality=0 and are now comprehensive articles with citations, EntityLinks, and balanced perspectives.
pr: 188
issues:
  - Research phase consistently returned "0 sources found" due to JSON parsing errors in the research output, but the improve phase still generated high-quality content using analysis data and model knowledge
  - Agentic-ai `--grade` flag hung after the improve pipeline completed successfully; quality score was set manually
learnings:
  - The Crux improve pipeline research phase JSON parsing is fragile — investigate the parser in a future session
  - Stub pages with only "This page is a stub. Content needed." are successfully handled by the standard tier improve pipeline
  - Running 2-3 improve pipelines in parallel works without API rate limit issues
