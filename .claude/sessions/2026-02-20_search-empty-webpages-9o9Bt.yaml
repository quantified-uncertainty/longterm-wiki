title: "Fix empty PR Descriptions dashboard and build-data path bug"
summary: |
  Investigated empty internal dashboards (user reported page-changes and
  pr-descriptions empty). PR #354 (already merged) fixed page-changes by
  correcting session log path. Found two additional bugs: (1) GITHUB_TOKEN
  not passed to build-data.mjs in CI workflows, causing prItems to be empty
  → pr-descriptions dashboard always shows no data; (2) scheduled-maintenance.yml
  ran build-data from repo root instead of apps/web/, causing REPO_ROOT to
  resolve to /home instead of the actual repo root. Fixed all three workflows.
