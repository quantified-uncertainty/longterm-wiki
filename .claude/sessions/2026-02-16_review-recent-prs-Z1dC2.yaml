title: Review PRs + add pre-push gate
pages: []
summary: "Reviewed PRs #142-#160 (15 PRs) for improvement patterns, then added `crux validate gate` command and `.githooks/pre-push` hook to mechanically enforce CI-blocking checks before every push. Added `prepare` script to auto-configure hooks on `pnpm install`."
pr: 171
learnings:
  - "Gate check runs 5 steps in ~33s: build-data, tests, MDX syntax, YAML schema, frontmatter schema"
  - "`--full` flag adds Next.js production build (~2-3min extra)"
  - Hook auto-activates via `prepare` script on `pnpm install` — no manual setup needed
  - NumericId conflicts are the dominant recurring problem (6+ fix commits in review window)
  - Crux pipeline is non-functional in Claude Code web sessions (3 sessions hit this)
