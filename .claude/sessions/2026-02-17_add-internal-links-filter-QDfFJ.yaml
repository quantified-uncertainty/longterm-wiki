title: Add Internal filter to Field row on /wiki
pages: []
summary: Added "Internal" as a filter option in the Field filter row on the /wiki explore page, allowing users to quickly filter for internal pages without scrolling through the Entity type filter.
learnings:
  - FIELD_GROUPS now supports an optional `entityType` property for type-based filtering alongside cluster-based filtering
  - The same pattern can be reused to add other type-based entries to the Field row in the future
