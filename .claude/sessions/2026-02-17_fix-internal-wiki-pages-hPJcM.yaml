title: DRY helpers and .md support for wiki infrastructure
pages: []
summary: Added `isFullWidth()` helper (eliminates 2x duplication in wiki route), `isIndexFile()` helper (eliminates 3x duplication in wiki-nav), and `.md` file support in research report generator. Rebased after parallel work on main superseded the original internal-page routing changes.
pr: 180
issues:
  - "Major rebase conflict: main merged opposite architectural approach (internal pages route through `/wiki/E<id>` instead of `/internal/*`), superseding ~80% of original PR changes"
  - Had to reset to main and apply only the still-additive DRY/defensive changes
learnings:
  - Main now routes internal pages through `/wiki/E<id>` with `isInternal` checks to hide wiki-only UI — our original `/internal/*` rendering approach was superseded
  - "`findMdxFiles()` in `crux/lib/file-utils.ts` already supports `.md`, so validate-mdx-compile.ts didn't need changes"
  - When parallel PRs diverge architecturally, better to reset to main and cherry-pick additive changes than attempt a complex rebase
