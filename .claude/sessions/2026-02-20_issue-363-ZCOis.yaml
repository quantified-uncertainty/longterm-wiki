title: "Populate missing entityType on 129 pages (#363)"
pr: https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/longterm-wiki/pull/369
issues:
  - "#363"
model: sonnet-4-6
duration: ~20min
cost: ~$0.50

summary: |
  Added entityType frontmatter field to 129 MDX pages that were missing it.
  Assignments follow directory structure conventions consistent with existing
  pages and crux/lib/category-entity-types.ts. One page (epistemics.mdx)
  was excluded due to a numericId conflict with a pre-existing YAML entity.

pages: []

learnings:
  - "Type mapping by directory: capabilities→capability, debates→debate, ai-transition-model→parameter, etc."
  - "Index pages got entityType: overview matching existing convention"
  - "Meta/nav pages (browse, dashboard, guides, project, internal) got entityType: internal"
  - "Excluded epistemics.mdx: numericId E319 conflicts with YAML entity tmc-epistemics"
  - "Tooling gap noted: no automated check for MDX pages with numericId matching YAML entity AND entityType set"
