## 2026-02-18 | claude/issue-270-IYmTX | Fix research JSON resilience + YAML date coercion

**What was done:** Improved research phase JSON parsing to recover partial data from truncated LLM responses using a multi-strategy approach (complete parse → partial array extraction → string field regex → fallback). Created a shared `loadYaml<T>()` utility using `js-yaml` `JSON_SCHEMA` option to prevent bare date strings being coerced into Date objects, then applied it across all `yaml.load()` call sites in the app.

**Pages:** none

**Model:** sonnet-4

**Duration:** ~30min

**Issues encountered:**
- JSON5/json-repair libraries not installed; implemented partial recovery without new dependencies using bracket-depth tracking.

**Learnings/notes:**
- `js-yaml` default schema auto-coerces `2026-02-18` to `Date` objects; `JSON_SCHEMA` option prevents this. All server-component YAML loading should use `loadYaml()` from `@lib/yaml`.
- Truncated LLM JSON responses occur when the response hits the token limit mid-array; partial extraction of complete objects is feasible with bracket matching.
