summary: Migrated all canonical fact IDs from human-readable slugs (e.g., `revenue-arr-2025`) to 8-char random hex hashes (e.g., `55d88868`), matching the pattern used by resources. Updated all YAML files, MDX references, build scripts, tests, LLM prompts, and documentation.
issues:
  - YAML stringify expanded scientific notation values (380e9 → 380000000000) — functionally equivalent but less readable in source
  - Build script required running from `app/` directory with tsx loader
learnings:
  - The measure auto-inference from fact ID prefixes is now dead code (replaced with explicit `measure:` fields). All migrated facts have explicit measures where they were previously inferred.
  - "`generateFactId()` utility added to `crux/resource-utils.ts` for creating new facts"
  - Migration mapping saved to `scripts/fact-id-mapping.json` for reference
