title: Update top-priority wiki page
pages:
  - ai-enabled-untraceable-misuse
summary: 'Updated the "AI-Enabled Untraceable Misuse" wiki page, which was the #1 priority on the Update Schedule (priority 7.08, 49 weeks overdue). Used the Crux content improve pipeline at standard tier to add new sections on attribution successes, legal/regulatory landscape, tradeoffs/limitations, and emerging approaches. Quality score improved from 35 to 88.'
pr: 188
issues:
  - Initially worked on wrong task (entityType migration from crux/TODO.md) before user clarified they meant wiki content updates
  - Research phase JSON parsing warning (non-fatal, pipeline continued successfully)
learnings:
  - '"Top of the list of next updates" refers to the Update Schedule page ranking wiki pages by staleness-weighted importance, not the crux/TODO.md code refactoring list'
