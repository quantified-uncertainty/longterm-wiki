title: Polish similarity graph UX
pages: []
summary: 'Three UX improvements to the similarity graph: (1) show labels for all connected nodes on hover (not just the hovered node), with pill-shaped backgrounds, (2) added "Show labels" toggle to display all node names at once in small 8px font, (3) fixed stats column width stability — now uses fixed `w-72` with `shrink-0`, `overflow-hidden`, and `truncate` so long titles never cause the control bar to reflow.'
pr: 140
learnings:
  - Canvas text labels at 8px are readable when zoomed in but get cluttered at default zoom with 600+ nodes — acceptable since it's an opt-in toggle
  - When `showAllLabels` is on during hover, non-connected node labels are drawn at lower opacity (0.25) to keep the focus on hovered+connected nodes
