## 2026-02-18 | claude/review-pr-216-P4Fcu | Fix audit report findings from PR #216

**What was done:** Reviewed PR #216 (comprehensive wiki audit report) and implemented fixes for the major issues it identified: fixed 181 path-style EntityLink IDs across 33 files, converted 164 broken EntityLinks (referencing non-existent entities) to plain text across 38 files, fixed a temporal inconsistency in anthropic.mdx, and added missing description fields to 53 ai-transition-model pages.

**Pages:** anthropic, anthropic-investors, openai, xai, meta-ai, scientific-research, projecting-compute-spending, lab-behavior, us-state-legislation, failed-stalled-proposals, effectiveness-assessment, canada-aida, colorado-ai-act, constitutional-ai, capability-unlearning, cooperative-ai, bioweapons, knowledge-monopoly, adaptability, adoption, ai-control-concentration, ai-governance, algorithms, alignment-robustness, biological-threat-exposure, companies, compute, coordination, countries, economic-power, economic-stability, governance, human-agency, human-expertise, institutional-quality, international-coordination

**Issues encountered:**
- pnpm install partially failed due to puppeteer network issues (resolved with --ignore-scripts)
- Many broken EntityLinks used path-style IDs (e.g. `risks/accident/scheming`) instead of slug-only IDs (`scheming`) — this was a systematic pattern across index pages

**Learnings/notes:**
- EntityLink IDs should always be slug-only (e.g. `scheming`), never path-style (e.g. `risks/accident/scheming`)
- ~100 entity concepts referenced in pages (like `deepseek`, `chatgpt`, `gpt-4`, `effective-altruism`) have no entity or page — these are candidates for future entity creation
- The 2 remaining component-refs errors are intentional template placeholders in internal docs
