title: Add YAML parse error handling in build-data.mjs
model: opus-4-6
duration: ~10min
pages: []
summary: "Added try-catch error handling around three unprotected `parse()` calls in `app/scripts/build-data.mjs` — in the path registry entity loader, facts loader, and fact-measures loader. The existing `loadYaml()` and `loadYamlDir()` functions already had error handling; this closes the remaining gaps. Fixes #246."
learnings:
  - The `loadYaml()` and `loadYamlDir()` functions already had try-catch handling when the issue was filed, but three other `parse()` call sites in the same file did not.
