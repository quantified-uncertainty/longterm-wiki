title: "Index llmSummary as a dedicated search field (issue #365)"
issue: 365
pr: https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/longterm-wiki/pull/370
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
duration: ~15 minutes
cost: ~$0.50
summary: |
  Added llmSummary as a separate indexed field in the MiniSearch search index.
  Previously, llmSummary was used as a fallback for description (one replaced the other).
  Now both are indexed independently, and both contribute to search ranking.

  Files changed: apps/web/scripts/lib/search.mjs (added llmSummary to SEARCH_FIELDS;
  separated it from description in document objects) and apps/web/src/lib/search.ts
  (added llmSummary to SEARCH_FIELDS and FIELD_BOOSTS with boost 1.5).

  Key decisions: Changed from fallback pattern (description: llmSummary || description)
  to both being indexed as independent fields. Boost weight 1.5 places llmSummary between
  description (2.0) and tags (1.5). Display still prefers llmSummary for search snippets.

  Gate: all 7 CI-blocking checks passed (220 tests). CI: build-and-test and validate green.
