title: Harden CI/CD pipeline
pages: []
summary: "Investigated why the Resolve Merge Conflicts Action didn't auto-fix PR #179's conflict, resolved it, then audited and hardened the entire CI/CD pipeline across 5 workflows."
pr: 183
issues:
  - "The Resolve Merge Conflicts workflow didn't catch PR #179 due to timing gap (PR created 5 min after last workflow run, 6h cron hadn't fired)"
learnings:
  - GitHub lazily computes `mergeable` — querying too soon returns `UNKNOWN`. Retry loop handles this.
  - The ci-autofix loop detector using `git log -3` could miss autofixes if normal commits interleave. `origin/main..HEAD` is reliable regardless of commit ordering.
