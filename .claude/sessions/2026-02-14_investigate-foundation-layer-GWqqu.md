## 2026-02-14 | claude/investigate-foundation-layer-GWqqu | Investigate Foundation-layer.ai

**What was done:** Researched foundation-layer.ai through web searches, direct URL fetching, and codebase searches. The domain exists (serves a Framer-built website with a dark burgundy color scheme) but has no extractable text content due to client-side rendering. No search engine indexing, no Crunchbase/LinkedIn profile, no press coverage, and no social media mentions were found.

**Pages:** (none)

**Issues encountered:**
- The foundation-layer.ai website is built with Framer and renders all content via JavaScript, making it impossible for server-side fetchers to extract text
- No search results exist for the domain across Google, Crunchbase, LinkedIn, or Twitter
- Subpages (/about, /team, /blog, /research, /mission) all return 404
- The only identifiable text from the HTML source was "The Foundation Layer" in a CSS comment and a dark burgundy (#2c0119) color scheme

**Learnings/notes:**
- foundation-layer.ai appears to be either pre-launch, in stealth mode, or an inactive/parked domain with a placeholder Framer page
- No existing references to foundation-layer.ai exist in the longterm-wiki codebase
- Not enough information is publicly available to create or justify a wiki page about this entity
- If more context becomes available (e.g., a launch announcement, press release, or LinkedIn page), the investigation could be revisited
