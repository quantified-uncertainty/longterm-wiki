title: Fix page-changes not reading session files
pages: []
summary: Fixed /internal/page-changes not updating for recent PRs. The build script only read from `.claude/session-log.md`, but session logging was migrated to per-session files in `.claude/sessions/` — so new sessions were invisible. Extracted parser to `app/scripts/lib/session-log-parser.mjs` with 12 tests covering both sources, deduplication, and ID filtering. Added cross-reference comment in session-logging rules.
pr: 136
learnings:
  - The migration to per-session files (to avoid merge conflicts) broke the data pipeline because the build script was never updated to read from the new location
  - Session files use the exact same `## date | branch | title` format as the consolidated log, so the same parser works on both
