## 2026-02-17 | claude/sonnet-4.6-update-f176B | Update codebase for Sonnet 4.6 launch

**What was done:** Updated model configuration, aliases, and hardcoded references from Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) to Sonnet 4.6 (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) across infrastructure code, GitHub workflow scripts, and internal documentation. Wiki content pages referencing Sonnet 4.5 were reviewed and confirmed to be historical (benchmark results, system card citations) — no content changes needed.

**Issues encountered:**
- Build data script (`build-data.mjs`) fails due to path resolution issue (pre-existing, unrelated to this change)

**Learnings/notes:**
- SquiggleAI pages (squiggleai.mdx, quri.mdx) reference Sonnet 4.5 as their primary model — these describe that tool's actual implementation and should only be updated when QURI confirms they've switched to Sonnet 4.6
- Sonnet 4.6 uses a date-less model ID format (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) matching Opus 4.6's convention
