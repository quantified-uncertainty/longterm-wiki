title: Wiki generation architecture research & proposal
pages:
  - wiki-generation-architecture
summary: Researched state-of-the-art approaches to scalable wiki generation (Stanford STORM, Microsoft GraphRAG, CrewAI, Self-Refine, SemanticCite, Anthropic multi-agent systems, KARMA) and wrote a comprehensive architecture proposal for multi-agent, multi-pass wiki page generation. The proposal covers 8 specialist agents, 12+ composable passes, knowledge graph-driven content planning, dynamic computation embedding, and iterative refinement loops.
pr: 173
issues:
  - pnpm install required --ignore-scripts due to puppeteer postinstall failure (known environment issue)
  - Pre-existing numericId conflicts (E698-E708) between internal pages infrastructure PR and parallel content branches -- not caused by this session
learnings:
  - Stanford STORM's perspective-guided research (mining perspectives from similar articles) is a strong idea we could adopt
  - Anthropic's own research found 90.2% improvement from multi-agent vs single-agent -- validates the architecture direction
  - 'The key insight from CrewAI: "Squeezing too much into one agent causes context windows to blow up, too many tools confuse it, and hallucinations increase"'
  - GraphRAG's community summaries could be computed at build-time from our existing entity clusters
  - SemanticCite's per-claim citation classification (SUPPORTED/PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED/UNSUPPORTED) is more rigorous than our current binary verify-sources approach
