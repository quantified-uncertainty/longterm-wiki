title: Rename app/ → apps/web/ to complete monorepo layout
model: sonnet-4
duration: ~2h
pages: []
summary: >
  Renamed the Next.js app from app/ to apps/web/ using git mv, completing the monorepo layout
  where apps/discord-bot/ already lived. Updated all path references across CI workflows,
  crux library, scripts, documentation, and configuration files. Fixed multiple path-depth
  bugs (build-data.mjs, content-types.mjs, and 6 files in apps/web/src/ that all used '../'
  to reach repo-root resources — now correctly use '../../'), updated the pnpm workspace
  definition, and rebased onto main to incorporate PR #302 (session log YAML format migration).
issues:
  - "build-data.mjs had TWO hardcoded path-depth bugs: CONTENT_DIR_ROOT used join(PROJECT_ROOT, '..', 'content/docs') (should be '../..') and REPO_ROOT in scripts/lib/content-types.mjs used join(PROJECT_ROOT, '..') (should be '../..'). The wrong CONTENT_DIR_ROOT caused entity auto-assignment to start at the wrong nextId, triggering the ID stability check."
  - "id-registry.json (gitignored) was corrupted by failed build runs with wrong entity IDs. Had to manually restore correct IDs (E851-E853) to unblock the stability check."
  - "The crux/lib/rules/frontmatter-schema.ts had a deep relative import path (../../../app/src/data/entity-type-names.ts) that needed updating."
  - "pnpm install was needed after updating pnpm-workspace.yaml to re-link the renamed workspace package."
  - "Full Next.js build (gate --full) revealed 6 more files in apps/web/src/ using process.cwd() with '../' to reach repo-root data: parameter-graph-data.ts, master-graph-data.ts, safety-generalizability.ts, index.ts, mdx.ts, auto-update-runs/page.tsx, auto-update-news/page.tsx (sources.yaml and state.yaml). All updated to '../../'."
learnings:
  - "When moving a workspace package to a deeper path, search for ALL relative path computations that use PROJECT_ROOT or process.cwd() with '../' — they all need one more level added. The initial gate check (without --full) won't catch Next.js-only paths that are only exercised during prerendering."
  - "Always run gate --full before pushing to catch prerender errors. The standard gate only runs build-data + tests + validations + tsc, not the actual Next.js build."
  - "The data/id-registry.json (gitignored) can be corrupted by failed builds. Always check its contents when debugging ID stability failures."
  - "git mv correctly handles bulk renames (all 250+ files moved atomically, git tracking preserved)."
recommendations:
  - "Consider replacing hardcoded '../' path constructions in build-data.mjs with the already-imported CONTENT_DIR/DATA_DIR constants from content-types.mjs to avoid depth-sensitive paths."
  - "The crux/lib/rules/frontmatter-schema.ts deep relative import (../../../apps/web/src/data/entity-type-names.ts) is fragile — consider adding a path alias or moving the import to go through GENERATED_DATA_DIR_ABS."
  - "Consider a shared path constant (REPO_ROOT or DATA_ROOT) defined once at the apps/web level to avoid scattered '../' computations that break on workspace layout changes."
