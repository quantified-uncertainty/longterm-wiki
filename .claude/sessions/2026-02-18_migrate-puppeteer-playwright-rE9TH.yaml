summary: Replaced Puppeteer with Playwright for the visual review screenshot feature. Updated `app/package.json` devDependency, rewrote `takeScreenshot()` in `crux/visual/visual-review.ts` to use Playwright's API (`chromium.launch`, `context.newPage`, `setViewportSize`, `networkidle`), and updated help text in `crux/commands/visual.ts`.
learnings:
  - Playwright uses `browser.newContext()` → `context.newPage()` instead of `browser.newPage()` directly
  - "`page.waitForTimeout()` is deprecated in Playwright; used `new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 3000))` instead"
  - "`waitUntil: 'networkidle'` replaces Puppeteer's `'networkidle2'`"
  - "`setViewportSize()` replaces `setViewport()`"
  - Playwright installed as 1.58.2 (latest available)
