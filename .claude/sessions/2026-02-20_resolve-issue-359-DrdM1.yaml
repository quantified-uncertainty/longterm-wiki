title: "Add clusters tags to 104 untagged knowledge-base pages (issue #359)"
pr: "https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/longterm-wiki/pull/371"

issue: 359

pages: []

summary: |
  Tagged all 104 untagged knowledge-base pages with 2-4 cluster values from
  the existing vocabulary (ai-safety, governance, community, epistemics,
  biorisks, cyber). This makes previously invisible pages discoverable in
  the tag browser and homepage topic clusters. Also assigned 5 new numericId
  values to history pages that lacked them.

key_decisions:
  - "Include index pages: Issue said ~89 pages; tagged 104 total (88 real + 16 index). Index pages were untagged too."
  - "Cluster assignment based on subcategory, entityType, title keywords, and similarity to already-tagged pages in same directory."
  - "Used unquoted cluster values consistently (some existing pages had quoted variants like \"ai-safety\")."
  - "Tooling gap: No automated validator checks that KB pages have a clusters field. A lint rule could catch this at CI time."
