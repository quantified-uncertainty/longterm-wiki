title: Fix "Human-assigned" quality label
pages:
  - architecture
summary: Changed "Human-assigned" to "LLM-assigned" in the quality rating tooltip (PageStatus.tsx) and internal architecture docs. Added a crux validation rule (`human-attribution`) and a vitest source-code scan (`no-human-attribution.test.ts`) to prevent this from recurring.
pr: 159
learnings:
  - Validation rules only cover MDX content in `content/docs/`; source code (TSX/TS) needs separate vitest tests for lint-like checks
