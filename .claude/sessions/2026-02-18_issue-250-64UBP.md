## 2026-02-18 | claude/issue-250-64UBP | Remove remaining dead components and exports

**What was done:** Removed remaining dead code identified in issue #250: deleted unused `updateFrontmatter` from mdx-utils.ts, removed `parseYamlResponse` and its tests from anthropic.ts, deleted the vestigial sidebar-utils.ts stub (removing sidebar infrastructure from validation-engine.ts too), deleted the `sidebar-coverage` validation rule (permanently broken — always produced 15 false-positive warnings since the sidebar is managed by Next.js), cleaned up a stale comment in component-imports.ts, and deleted the outdated DEAD-CODE-REPORT.md. Most items in the issue had already been cleaned up in prior sessions.

**Model:** opus-4-6

**Duration:** ~20min

**Issues encountered:**
- Most dead code listed in issue #250 was already removed in prior cleanup sessions; only ~4 items remained actionable

**Learnings/notes:**
- The DEAD-CODE-REPORT.md was significantly outdated and tracked items already cleaned up — deleting it reduces confusion
- sidebar-utils.ts was a stub file whose only function returned empty data; inlining the empty value directly in validation-engine.ts is cleaner
