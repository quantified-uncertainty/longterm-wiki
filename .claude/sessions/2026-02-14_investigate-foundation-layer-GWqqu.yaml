title: Investigate and integrate Foundation-layer.ai
pages:
  - the-foundation-layer
  - funders-overview
summary: "Investigated foundation-layer.ai, extracted content via Jina reader proxy, then integrated findings into the wiki: created a new organization page, added entity definition, added resource entry, and updated funders-overview with The Foundation Layer Fund and AISTOF."
pr: 144
issues:
  - Framer site is entirely JS-rendered; direct WebFetch returned only CSS/JS boilerplate
  - Solved by using Jina AI reader proxy (`https://r.jina.ai/<url>`)
  - "Crux `content create` pipeline failed: Perplexity/Firecrawl APIs unreachable due to network restrictions"
  - Used `--source-file` flag to bypass research phases, but synthesis step (which spawns a `claude` subprocess) hung for 20+ minutes without progress
  - Fell back to manual page creation per CLAUDE.md last-resort protocol
  - GitHub API inaccessible (local proxy doesn't support it), so issues for missing org pages documented below instead
learnings:
  - For JS-rendered sites, `https://r.jina.ai/<url>` renders JS before extracting markdown
  - Crux `content create --source-file=<path>` skips research phases when external APIs are blocked
  - The spawned `claude` subprocess in the synthesis phase may not work in all environments
  - "GitHub issues to create (could not be created due to API access):"
