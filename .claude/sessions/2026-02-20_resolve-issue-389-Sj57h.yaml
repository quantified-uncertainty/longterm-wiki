title: "Fix incidents index page — add EntityLinks and content listings"
issue: 389
pr: https://github.com/quantified-uncertainty/longterm-wiki/pull/391
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
duration: ~20min

  - id: __index__/knowledge-base/incidents

summary: |
  Added EntityLink import and a categorized "Documented Incidents" section to the
  incidents index page. Two incident pages are now discoverable from the index:
  Claude Code Espionage (2025) under "Cyber Operations & Security" and OpenClaw
  Matplotlib Incident (2026) under "Autonomous Agent Behavior". Follows the same
  pattern as other section index pages (capabilities, risks, history).

key_decisions:
  - "EntityLink IDs: used page slugs (claude-code-espionage-2025, openclaw-matplotlib-incident-2026) rather than numericIds — consistent with other index pages."
  - "Categorization: split into two subsections based on clearly distinct incident types."
  - "Tooling gap: no automated check detects section index pages that don't link to their child pages. Discovered via manual website consistency audit (PR #349 item 16)."
