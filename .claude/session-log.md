# Session Log

Reverse-chronological log of Claude Code sessions on this repo. Each session appends a summary before its final commit. See `.claude/rules/session-logging.md` for the format.

## 2026-02-13 | claude/review-wiki-report-XQW88 | Review and rewrite E686 OpenClaw Matplotlib Incident

**What was done:** Two-pass review and rewrite of the E686 wiki page. First pass: cut redundant theoretical sections, added investigative sections ("The Agent's Identity and Background", "Was This Really an Autonomous Agent?"), added HN stats, PR reaction ratios, agent apology, Klymak quote, media coverage. Second pass: deep investigation of agent's digital footprint — found two git commit emails (`crabby.rathbun@gmail.com` and `mj@crabbyrathbun.dev`), the `crabbyrathbun.dev` domain purchase, GitHub Issues #4/#17/#24 revealing SOUL.md refusal and operator acknowledgment, commit timestamp analysis, 26 computational chemistry forks, pump.fun memecoins (\$569K peak market cap), and zero-following GitHub pattern. Added 13 new sources total.

**Issues encountered:**
- pnpm install fails on puppeteer postinstall (known issue), `--ignore-scripts` workaround used

**Learnings/notes:**
- The `crabbyrathbun.dev` domain WHOIS is the strongest unexplored lead for operator identification
- pump.fun tokens were created AFTER virality (Feb 13), not by the operator — opportunistic third parties
- Commit timestamps for human-setup activities cluster at 18:00-19:00 UTC (ambiguous timezone)

## 2026-02-13 | claude/add-llm-warning-banner-aWFt0 | Add LLM warning banner to wiki pages

**What was done:** Added a dismissible warning banner to all wiki pages informing readers that content was written by an LLM with minimal human supervision. The banner uses localStorage to persist dismissal, so once closed it stays hidden across all pages.

**Issues encountered:**
- pnpm install fails on puppeteer postinstall (known issue), `--ignore-scripts` workaround used

**Learnings/notes:**
- Banner is a client component (`"use client"`) since it needs useState/useEffect for localStorage
- Placed between ContentMeta (breadcrumbs) and the article content in the wiki page layout
- Defaults to hidden on initial render to avoid flash, then shows after checking localStorage

## 2026-02-13 | claude/fix-sidebar-link-styles-2tINm | Fix InfoBox sidebar link styles

**What was done:** Updated the InfoBox "Related Entries" section to use `EntityLink` components instead of plain `Link` components, giving sidebar links the same background color styling and hover tooltip popups as main content links. Added `id` field to resolved related entries in the data layer, changed InfoBox Card from `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-visible` so tooltips aren't clipped, fixed `pluralize()` bugs ("analysises" → "analyses", "persons" → "people"), and tightened Related section spacing with a flex-wrap layout.

**Issues encountered:**
- pnpm install fails on puppeteer postinstall (known issue), `--ignore-scripts` workaround used

**Learnings/notes:**
- The InfoBox Card previously used `overflow-hidden` which would clip any absolutely-positioned tooltips; changed to `overflow-visible` with rounded header corners instead
- The `pluralize()` helper needed both a -sis → -ses rule and an irregular plurals map

## 2026-02-13 | claude/find-ai-revenue-pages-PEKvH | Investigate LLM crawlability of longtermwiki.com

**What was done:** Investigated why LLMs can't find longtermwiki.com pages via web search. Found the site already has comprehensive llms.txt infrastructure (llms.txt, llms-core.txt, llms-full.txt, per-page .txt files) generated by build-data.mjs. Added `LLMs-Txt` directive to robots.txt. Identified relevant AI revenue pages (ai-revenue-sources, projecting-compute-spending, anthropic-valuation, economic-disruption, etc.). Root cause is likely low domain authority/backlinks rather than technical SEO issues.

**Issues encountered:**
- pnpm install fails on puppeteer postinstall (network issue), but `--ignore-scripts` works fine
- build-data.mjs must be run from app/ directory (uses process.cwd() for path resolution)

**Learnings/notes:**
- The llms.txt system is already well-implemented — files are generated during build and served from public/
- llms*.txt files are gitignored (generated at build time), which is correct since Vercel runs build-data.mjs
- The site's main discoverability issue is search engine indexing, not technical configuration — recommend submitting sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools

## 2026-02-13 | claude/session-logging-tracking-d4d6K | Add session logging system

**What was done:** Created a session logging and common-issues tracking system. Added `.claude/rules/session-logging.md` (instructs each session to log a summary), `.claude/session-log.md` (the log itself), and `.claude/common-issues.md` (recurring issues and solutions seeded from CLAUDE.md knowledge).

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Learnings/notes:**
- Hook-based logging (SessionStart/SessionEnd) captures metadata but not what actually happened. Rule-based self-logging is more useful for understanding session outcomes.
- The `.claude/rules/` directory is read automatically by Claude Code — no settings.json needed for rules.
