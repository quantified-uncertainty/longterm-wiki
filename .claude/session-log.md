# Session Log

Reverse-chronological log of Claude Code sessions on this repo. Each session appends a summary before its final commit. See `.claude/rules/session-logging.md` for the format.

## 2026-02-13 | claude/fix-sidebar-link-styles-2tINm | Fix InfoBox sidebar link styles

**What was done:** Updated the InfoBox "Related Entries" section to use `EntityLink` components instead of plain `Link` components, giving sidebar links the same background color styling and hover tooltip popups as main content links. Added `id` field to resolved related entries in the data layer, changed InfoBox Card from `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-visible` so tooltips aren't clipped, fixed `pluralize()` bugs ("analysises" → "analyses", "persons" → "people"), and tightened Related section spacing with a flex-wrap layout.

**Issues encountered:**
- pnpm install fails on puppeteer postinstall (known issue), `--ignore-scripts` workaround used

**Learnings/notes:**
- The InfoBox Card previously used `overflow-hidden` which would clip any absolutely-positioned tooltips; changed to `overflow-visible` with rounded header corners instead
- The `pluralize()` helper needed both a -sis → -ses rule and an irregular plurals map

## 2026-02-13 | claude/find-ai-revenue-pages-PEKvH | Investigate LLM crawlability of longtermwiki.com

**What was done:** Investigated why LLMs can't find longtermwiki.com pages via web search. Found the site already has comprehensive llms.txt infrastructure (llms.txt, llms-core.txt, llms-full.txt, per-page .txt files) generated by build-data.mjs. Added `LLMs-Txt` directive to robots.txt. Identified relevant AI revenue pages (ai-revenue-sources, projecting-compute-spending, anthropic-valuation, economic-disruption, etc.). Root cause is likely low domain authority/backlinks rather than technical SEO issues.

**Issues encountered:**
- pnpm install fails on puppeteer postinstall (network issue), but `--ignore-scripts` works fine
- build-data.mjs must be run from app/ directory (uses process.cwd() for path resolution)

**Learnings/notes:**
- The llms.txt system is already well-implemented — files are generated during build and served from public/
- llms*.txt files are gitignored (generated at build time), which is correct since Vercel runs build-data.mjs
- The site's main discoverability issue is search engine indexing, not technical configuration — recommend submitting sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools

## 2026-02-13 | claude/session-logging-tracking-d4d6K | Add session logging system

**What was done:** Created a session logging and common-issues tracking system. Added `.claude/rules/session-logging.md` (instructs each session to log a summary), `.claude/session-log.md` (the log itself), and `.claude/common-issues.md` (recurring issues and solutions seeded from CLAUDE.md knowledge).

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Learnings/notes:**
- Hook-based logging (SessionStart/SessionEnd) captures metadata but not what actually happened. Rule-based self-logging is more useful for understanding session outcomes.
- The `.claude/rules/` directory is read automatically by Claude Code — no settings.json needed for rules.
