    unsupported: The source does not mention the closure of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford in April 2024.
    unsupported: The source does not mention internal tensions between neartermist and longtermist factions.

It focuses on specific modeling assumptions related to existential risk reduction.

    WRONG DATE: The article states the closure date was April 16, 2024, not simply April 2024.
    MISLEADING PARAPHRASE: The claim that the closure of the Future of Humanity Institute marked the largest single institutional loss in the longtermist research ecosystem is an overclaim. The article only states that the University of Oxford closed the Institute.
    UNSUPPORTED: The source does not mention the collapse of FTX, the fraud conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried, internal tensions between neartermist and longtermist factions, or critics challenging longtermism's epistemological foundations.
