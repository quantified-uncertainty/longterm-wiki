  issues: The claim contains multiple unsupported dates and forecasts that are not mentioned in the source text. Specifically, the 2016, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 forecasts are not present in the provided document. The 2024 Metaculus community median is mentioned as July 2031 at the start of 2025, which later moved to November 2033, not 2028-2031 as the claim states. The AI 2027 scenario is mentioned, but the April 2025 publication date is not. The claim about forecasts extending again in late 2025 is supported, but the specific reason is slightly different. The AI Futures Model median at 2032.5 is not mentioned, nor is the Kwa/METR model predicting 99% AI R&D automation by late 2032. The Metaculus flagship question median at approximately early 2028 is also not mentioned.
