  issues: The source mentions Ajeya Cotra's report and discusses the biological anchors framework, but it does not explicitly state that the framework estimates TAI timelines by comparing required computational resources (measured in FLOP) to biological systems. While the report does involve comparing computational resources to biological systems, the claim overstates the explicitness of this comparison as the core method.

    WRONG NUMBERS: The claim states Hassabis made the first statement in March 2025, but the article was published in March 2024 and refers to a statement made on Monday at a briefing in DeepMind's London offices.
    WRONG NUMBERS: The claim states Hassabis gave a 50% chance of achieving AGI by the end of 2030 at Davos in January 2026, but the article references a statement made by Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, at Davos in January.
    FABRICATED DETAILS: The claim states Hassabis described his timeline as moving from "as soon as 10 years" in autumn 2025 to "probably three to five years away" by early 2026, but this is not mentioned in the article.

  issues: The claim contains multiple unsupported dates and forecasts that are not mentioned in the source text. Specifically, the 2016, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 forecasts are not present in the provided document. The 2024 Metaculus community median is mentioned as July 2031 at the start of 2025, which later moved to November 2033, not 2028-2031 as the claim states. The AI 2027 scenario is mentioned, but the April 2025 publication date is not. The claim about forecasts extending again in late 2025 is supported, but the specific reason is slightly different. The AI Futures Model median at 2032.5 is not mentioned, nor is the Kwa/METR model predicting 99% AI R&D automation by late 2032. The Metaculus flagship question median at approximately early 2028 is also not mentioned.

    WRONG NUMBERS: The wiki claim states a median estimate of February 1, 2028, based on over 1,700 forecasters, with an interquartile range spanning July 2026 to August 2031. The source does not provide this information. Instead, it states that as of February 2026, the forecasters average a 25% chance of AGI by 2029 and 50% by 2033.
    WRONG NUMBERS: The wiki claim states that a separate Metaculus question on transformative AI clusters around 2029–2031 for median arrival. The source does not provide this information.
    MISLEADING PARAPHRASE: The wiki claim states that the 80,000 Hours analysis of these surveys notes that Metaculus forecasters' mean estimate for AGI development has moved from approximately 50 years out to approximately 5 years out over a four-year period. The source states that 'In four years, the mean estimate on Metaculus for when AGI will be developed has plummeted from 50 years to five years.' This is not explicitly stated as an 80,000 Hours analysis.
