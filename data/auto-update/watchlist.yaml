      Search for new developments related to Jeffrey Epstein's connections to AI researchers and
      organizations. Look for: newly released DOJ documents or court filings mentioning AI-adjacent
      researchers, newly identified funding relationships, institutional responses and policy
      changes at MIT, Harvard, Oxford or other universities, ongoing litigation outcomes, and
      coverage in scientific or ethics publications. Update sections with any confirmed new
      information and add citations for new sources. Do not speculate beyond confirmed facts. If
      nothing significant has changed, make only minor polish improvements.
