# Pages scheduled for regular forced updates regardless of news routing.
# The auto-update orchestrator checks this list on every run and injects
# due entries directly into the update plan.
#
# Fields:
#   pageId:         Wiki page ID (must match MDX filename without extension)
#   frequency_days: Days between forced updates (7 = weekly, 30 = monthly)
#   expires:        Stop updating after this date (YYYY-MM-DD, inclusive)
#   tier:           Update quality tier: polish | standard | deep
#   directions:     Specific instructions passed to the page improver
#   last_run:       Auto-maintained: ISO date of last forced update (null if never)
#
# Adding a page here guarantees it will be refreshed at least once per
# frequency_days window, independent of whether any news was routed to it.
# The `expires` field prevents the list from accumulating stale entries.

      Search for new developments related to Jeffrey Epstein's connections to
      AI researchers and organizations. Look for: newly released DOJ documents
      or court filings mentioning AI-adjacent researchers, newly identified
      funding relationships, institutional responses and policy changes at MIT,
      Harvard, Oxford or other universities, ongoing litigation outcomes, and
      coverage in scientific or ethics publications. Update sections with any
      confirmed new information and add citations for new sources. Do not
      speculate beyond confirmed facts. If nothing significant has changed,
      make only minor polish improvements.
