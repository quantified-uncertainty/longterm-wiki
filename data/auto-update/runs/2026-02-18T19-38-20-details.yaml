        matching the preferences of the external human labelers, though those preferences did not always match our own.
        Specifically, for summarization tasks the labelers preferred sentences copied wholesale from the input (we’d
        only asked them to ensure accuracy), so our models learned to copy. Summarization required 60k human labels;

      summary: Published on February 12, 2026 4:55 PM GMTAs AI systems get more capable, it becomes increasingly uncompetitive
        and infeasible to avoid deferring to AIs on increasingly many decisions. Further, once systems are sufficiently
        capable, control becomes infeasible. [1] Thus, one of the main strategies for handling AI risk is fully (or
        almost fully) deferring to AIs on managing these risks. Broadly speaking, when I say "deferring to AIs" [2] I
        mean having these AIs do virtually all of the work to deve

      summary: Published on February 3, 2026 1:08 AM GMTIf AIs became strategically competent enough, they may realize that
        RSI is too dangerous because they're not good enough at alignment or philosophy or strategy, and potentially
        convince, help, or work with humans to implement an AI pause. This presents an alternative "victory condition"
        that someone could pursue (e.g. by working on AI strategic competence) if they were relatively confident about

      summary: We trained “critique-writing” models to describe flaws in summaries. Human evaluators find flaws in summaries
        much more often when shown our model’s critiques. Larger models are better at self-critiquing, with scale
        improving critique-writing more than summary-writing. This shows promise for using AI systems to assist human
        supervision of AI systems on difficult tasks.

      summary: We’ve observed agents discovering progressively more complex tool use while playing a simple game of
        hide-and-seek. Through training in our new simulated hide-and-seek environment, agents build a series of six
        distinct strategies and counterstrategies, some of which we did not know our environment supported. The
        self-supervised emergent complexity in this simple environment further suggests that multi-agent co-adaptation
        may one day produce extremely complex and intelligent behavior.

        performance across a more diverse range of unforeseen attacks.

      summary: One step towards building safe AI systems is to remove the need for humans to write goal functions, since using
        a simple proxy for a complex goal, or getting the complex goal a bit wrong, can lead to undesirable and even
        dangerous behavior. In collaboration with DeepMind’s safety team, we’ve developed an algorithm which can infer
        what humans want by being told which of two proposed behaviors is better.

      summary: We’ve discovered neurons in CLIP that respond to the same concept whether presented literally, symbolically, or
        conceptually. This may explain CLIP’s accuracy in classifying surprising visual renditions of concepts, and is
        also an important step toward understanding the associations and biases that CLIP and similar models learn.

        versus the world champion Dota 2 team, OG, at Finals this weekend. Both OpenAI Five and DeepMind’s AlphaStar had
        previously beaten good pros privately but lost their live pro matches, making this also the first time an AI has

      summary: We’ve made progress towards stable and scalable training of energy-based models (EBMs) resulting in better
        sample quality and generalization ability than existing models. Generation in EBMs spends more compute to
        continually refine its answers and doing so can generate samples competitive with GANs at low temperatures,
        while also having mode coverage guarantees of likelihood-based models. We hope these findings stimulate further
        research into this promising class of models.

      summary: We’re introducing a neural network called CLIP which efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language
        supervision. CLIP can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply providing the names of the
        visual categories to be recognized, similar to the “zero-shot” capabilities of GPT-2 and GPT-3.

      summary: We’ve discovered that the gradient noise scale, a simple statistical metric, predicts the parallelizability of
        neural network training on a wide range of tasks. Since complex tasks tend to have noisier gradients,
        increasingly large batch sizes are likely to become useful in the future, removing one potential limit to
        further growth of AI systems. More broadly, these results show that neural network training need not be
        considered a mysterious art, but can be rigorized and systematized.

        model trained on pixel sequences can generate coherent image completions and samples. By establishing a
        correlation between sample quality and image classification accuracy, we show that our best generative model
        also contains features competitive with top convolutional nets in the unsupervised setting.

      summary: Our Dota 2 result shows that self-play can catapult the performance of machine learning systems from far below
        human level to superhuman, given sufficient compute. In the span of a month, our system went from barely
        matching a high-ranked player to beating the top pros and has continued to improve since then. Supervised deep
        learning systems can only be as good as their training datasets, but in self-play systems, the available data
        improves automatically as the agent gets better.

      summary: We’ve found that self-play allows simulated AIs to discover physical skills like tackling, ducking, faking,
        kicking, catching, and diving for the ball, without explicitly designing an environment with these skills in
        mind. Self-play ensures that the environment is always the right difficulty for an AI to improve. Taken
        alongside our Dota 2 self-play results, we have increasing confidence that self-play will be a core part of
        powerful AI systems in the future.

        networks with block-sparse weights. Depending on the chosen sparsity, these kernels can run orders of magnitude
        faster than cuBLAS or cuSPARSE. We’ve used them to attain state-of-the-art results in text sentiment analysis
        and generative modeling of text and images."

        of human Minecraft play, while using only a small amount of labeled contractor data. With fine-tuning, our model
        can learn to craft diamond tools, a task that usually takes proficient humans over 20 minutes (24,000 actions).
        Our model uses the native human interface of keypresses and mouse movements, making it quite general, and
        represents a step towards general computer-using agents.
