      summary: Amodei states that recent progress — especially results on circuits and interpretability-based testing — has
        made him feel that Anthropic is "on the verge of cracking interpretability in a big way," with a realistic path
        towards interpretability becoming a sophisticated and reliable way to diagnose problems in even very advanced
        AI. He notes it is likely that a key part of how the most capable models will be tested and deployed — such as
        those at AI Safety Level 4 — will involve performing and f

      summary: " Anthropic's research teams investigate the safety, inner workings, and societal impacts of AI models — so
        that artificial intelligence has a positive impact as it becomes increasingly capable. Recent circuit-tracing
        work lets researchers watch Claude think, uncovering a shared conceptual space where reasoning happens before
        being translated into language. One paper provides the first empirical example of a model engaging in alignment
        faking without being trained to do so — selectively complying"
