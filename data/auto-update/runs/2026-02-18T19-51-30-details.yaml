      summary: ' Applications are now open for two new cohorts beginning in May and July 2026, covering a wide range of safety
        research areas — including scalable oversight, adversarial robustness, AI control, mechanistic interpretability,
        AI security, and model welfare. The interpretability mission focuses on understanding the internal workings of
        large language models, with fellows having introduced new methods to trace model "thoughts" by generating

        patterns of activations within their neural networks; by extracting "persona vectors" for traits like sycophancy
