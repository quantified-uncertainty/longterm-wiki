      Autonomous weapons systems create a ~10,000x speed mismatch between human decision-making (5-30 minutes) and
      machine action cycles (0.2-0.7 seconds), making meaningful human control effectively impossible during the

      AI models achieving 97% accuracy on ImageNet benchmarks crash to just 50-55% accuracy when tested on ObjectNet's
      real-world images—a 40-45 percentage point collapse that persists even when trained on 1,000x more data.

      GPT-4 can exploit 87% of disclosed vulnerabilities at just \$8.80 per successful exploit—but without CVE
      descriptions, success drops to only 7%, revealing AI excels at weaponizing known vulnerabilities rather than
      discovering novel ones.

      UK AISI auditing games found black-box sandbagging detection methods achieve near 0% success rates, while
      white-box linear probes reach 70-85% detection accuracy—a critical gap given that most external evaluators lack
      model weight access.

      AI labs have cut safety evaluation timelines by 70-80% since ChatGPT launched, with external review periods
      dropping from 6-8 weeks to just 1-2 weeks, and red team assessments compressed from 8-12 weeks to 2-4 weeks.

      Safety budget allocation at major labs dropped from 12% to 6% of R&D spending between 2022-2024, while safety
      evaluation staff turnover increased 340% following major competitive events—suggesting a structural brain drain
      from safety to capabilities work.

      OpenAI's o3 model demonstrates that inference-time compute can scale up to 10,000x, allowing a model trained below
      regulatory thresholds (10^24 FLOP) to perform at the level of a 10^27 FLOP model—completely bypassing current EU
      and US regulations that only measure training compute.

      First cohort companies (July 2023) achieved 69% compliance with White House voluntary AI commitments while second
