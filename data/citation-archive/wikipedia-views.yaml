    claimContext: Critics of the AI-centric explanation for pageview declines argue that significant drops began well before recent generative AI systems emerged. Declines started as early as 2013-2014, primarily due to mobile traffic dominance (larger than desktop since 2015) and Google Knowledge Graph snippets that
