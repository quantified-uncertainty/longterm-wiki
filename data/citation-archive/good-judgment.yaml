The effectiveness of judgmental forecasting approaches is fundamentally constrained by forecasters' inherent biases, which can lead to inadequate forecasts and failure to acknowledge poor performance.[^79] While Good Judg"

It was still the early days of the pandemic in the States, with quite a bit of disagreement among the various models, and data so messy that some simply chose not to predict. But messy-data, high-interest questions are precisely what superforecasters aim to clarify. To properly tackle the overall picture, they br
