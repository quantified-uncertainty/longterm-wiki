# Fact Measure Definitions
#
# Measures are first-class concepts in the knowledge graph — the "verbs/nouns"
# that describe what is being measured. Each measure has rich metadata for
# chart generation, cross-entity comparison, and knowledge graph queries.
#
# Every fact observation is a (Subject, Measure, Time, Value) tuple:
#   (Anthropic, valuation, 2026-02, $380B)
#   (OpenAI,    valuation, 2025,    $500B)
#
# Naming: We use "measure" (not "metric") to avoid collision with the existing
# wiki entity type "metric" which represents measurement domain pages.
