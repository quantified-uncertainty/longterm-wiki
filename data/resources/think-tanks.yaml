  title: Carnegie Endowment - Can Democracy Survive the Disruptive Power of AI?
  type: web
  local_filename: 087288a8d8338b97.txt
  summary: The article explores how advanced AI technologies can destabilize democratic systems by
    enabling rapid creation of synthetic content and foreign interference. It examines the risks of
    AI-generated misinformation and proposes multi-stakeholder strategies to mitigate these
    challenges.
  review: Carnegie Endowment's analysis provides a comprehensive examination of the emerging threats
    posed by generative AI to democratic institutions. The core argument centers on how AI
    technologies, particularly large language models and image generation tools, can be weaponized
    to create sophisticated misinformation, manipulate electoral processes, and undermine public
    trust. By enabling malicious actors to produce highly convincing synthetic content at
    unprecedented speed and scale, these technologies challenge the fundamental information
    integrity that democracies rely upon. The report highlights multiple dimensions of this
    challenge, from AI-generated deepfakes in political campaigns to the potential for foreign
    interference and digital authoritarianism. While acknowledging the innovative potential of AI,
    the authors emphasize the urgent need for a multi-faceted response involving technological
    solutions, regulatory frameworks, and public education. Key recommendations include content
    watermarking, platform accountability, digital literacy programs, and international cooperation
    to develop harmonized standards for detecting and mitigating AI-generated disinformation. The
    analysis serves as a critical wake-up call for policymakers, tech companies, and citizens about
    the profound epistemic risks emerging technologies pose to democratic discourse.
  key_points:
    - Generative AI enables rapid creation of convincing synthetic content that can manipulate
      public perception
    - Political campaigns and foreign actors are already using AI to generate deepfakes and spread
      misinformation
    - Comprehensive strategies involving technology, regulation, and education are crucial to
      mitigate risks
