# Fact Metric Definitions
#
# Metrics are reusable "measurement types" that group related facts across
# entities and time. A fact with `metric: valuation` is a point-in-time
# observation of the "valuation" metric for that entity.
#
# This enables:
#   - Timeseries: all valuations for Anthropic over time
#   - Cross-entity comparison: all company valuations at a given date
#   - Knowledge graph queries: "what metrics does this entity have?"
#   - Auto-generated charts and tables
