  title: EA Shareholder Diversification from Anthropic
  description: >-
    Analysis of strategies for EA-aligned Anthropic shareholders to reduce portfolio
    concentration risk. At $380B valuation, $27-76B in risk-adjusted EA capital is
    tied to a single illiquid asset. Key strategies include secondary market sales,
    expanded buybacks, DAF transfers, and post-IPO systematic selling plans.

    Rather than working on AI safety from outside, this category involves directly influencing frontier AI labs from
    within or through stakeholder pressure. The theory is that since labs are building potentially dangerous systems,
    shaping their decisions and culture may be the most direct path to safety.

    AI systems designed with formal mathematical safety guarantees from the ground up. The UK's

    neural network verification handles networks up to 10^6 parameters, but frontier models
    exceed 10^12, representing a 6 order-of-magnitude gap. Estimated 1-5% probability of
    paradigm dominance at transformative AI.
