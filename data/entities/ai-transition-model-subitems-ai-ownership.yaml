          model](/knowledge-base/models/impact-models/economic-disruption-impact/) analyzes how
          AI-driven automation interacts with ownership structures to affect wealth distribution.


          ### The Inequality Spiral




          If AI displaces 20-30% of jobs over the next decade while productivity gains flow
          primarily to capital owners, the inequality spiral becomes self-reinforcing.


          ### Historical Precedent


          MIT research indicates **50-70%** of US wage inequality growth since 1980 stems from
          automation, before the current AI surge."

          | **Google DeepMind** | Division | Alphabet shareholders | Traditional corporate
