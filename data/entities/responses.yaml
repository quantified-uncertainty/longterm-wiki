    Compute governance uses computational hardware as a lever to regulate AI development. Because advanced AI requires
    enormous amounts of computing power, and that compute comes from concentrated supply chains, controlling compute
    provides a tractable way to govern AI before models are built.

    Compute thresholds define capability boundaries using training compute (measured in FLOP) as a proxy. The EU AI Act
    uses 10^25 FLOP for GPAI obligations; the US Executive Order uses 10^26 FLOP for reporting requirements. These
    thresholds aim to capture frontier models while minimizing regulatory burden on smaller systems.

    Epistemic security refers to protecting society's collective capacity for truth-finding in an era when AI can
    generate convincing false content at unprecedented scale. Just as national security protects against physical
    threats, epistemic security protects against threats to our ability to know what is true and form shared beliefs
    about reality.


    The threat landscape includes AI-generated deepfakes that can fabricate video evidence, language models that can
    produce unlimited quantities of persuasive misinformation, and systems that can personalize deceptive content to
    individual vulnerabilities. These capabilities threaten the basic information infrastructure that democratic
    societies depend on - the shared understanding of facts that enables public deliberation, elections, and collective
    decision-making.


    Defending epistemic security requires multiple layers: technical tools for content authentication and provenance,
    media literacy education that teaches critical evaluation of information sources, institutional reforms that
    increase resilience to manipulation, and regulatory frameworks that create accountability for platforms and AI
    developers. The challenge is that offensive capabilities (generating false content) are advancing faster than
    defensive capabilities (detecting it), creating an asymmetry that favors attackers.

  description: >
    AI-augmented forecasting combines the pattern-recognition and data-processing capabilities of AI systems with the
    contextual judgment and calibration of human forecasters. This hybrid approach aims to produce more accurate
    predictions about future events than either humans or AI alone, particularly for questions relevant to policy and
    risk assessment.


    Current systems take several forms. AI can aggregate and weight forecasts from many human predictors, adjusting for
    individual track records and biases. AI can assist forecasters by synthesizing relevant information, identifying
    base rates, and flagging considerations that might otherwise be missed. More ambitiously, AI systems can generate
    their own forecasts that human superforecasters then evaluate and combine with their own judgments.


    For AI safety and epistemic security, improved forecasting offers several benefits. Better predictions about AI
    capabilities help with governance timing. Forecasting AI-related risks provides early warning. Publicly visible
    forecasts create accountability for claims about AI development. The key challenge is calibration - ensuring that
    probability estimates are meaningful across diverse domains and maintaining accuracy as AI systems become the
    subject of the forecasts themselves.

  description: >
    Content authentication technologies aim to establish verifiable provenance for digital content - allowing users to
    confirm where content came from, whether it has been modified, and whether it was created by AI or humans. The goal
    is to rebuild trust in digital media by creating technical guarantees of authenticity that complement human
    judgment.


    The leading approach is the C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) standard, backed by major
    technology companies. C2PA embeds cryptographically signed metadata into content at the point of creation - when a
    photo is taken, when a video is recorded, when an AI generates an image. This creates a chain of custody that can be
    verified later. Other approaches include invisible watermarking (SynthID), blockchain-based verification, and
    forensic analysis tools that detect signs of synthetic generation or manipulation.


    The key challenges are adoption and circumvention. Content authentication only works if it becomes universal - if
    users come to expect provenance information and distrust content without it. But metadata can be stripped,
    watermarks can potentially be removed or spoofed, and AI-generated content without credentials can still circulate.
    The race between authentication and forgery capability is uncertain, but authentication provides one of the few
    technical defenses against the coming flood of synthetic content.

    Coordination technologies are tools and mechanisms that enable actors to cooperate on collective challenges when
    individual incentives favor defection. For AI safety, these technologies address the fundamental problem that racing
    to develop AI faster may be individually rational but collectively catastrophic. For epistemic security, they help
    coordinate defensive responses to disinformation.


    These technologies draw on mechanism design, game theory, and institutional economics. Examples include:
    verification protocols that allow actors to confirm others' compliance with agreements (critical for AI safety
    treaties); commitment devices that make defection from cooperative arrangements costly; signaling mechanisms that
    allow actors to credibly communicate intentions; and platforms that make coordination focal points more visible.


    For AI governance specifically, coordination technologies might include compute monitoring systems that verify
    compliance with training restrictions, international registries of advanced AI systems, and mechanisms for sharing
    safety research while protecting commercial interests. The fundamental insight from Elinor Ostrom's work is that
    collective action problems are not unsolvable - but they require deliberate institutional design. The urgency of AI
    risk makes developing effective coordination mechanisms for this domain a priority.

  description: >
    AI-assisted deliberation uses AI to scale meaningful democratic dialogue beyond the constraints of traditional town
    halls and focus groups. Rather than replacing human deliberation with AI decisions, these tools use AI to
    facilitate, synthesize, and scale genuine human discussion - enabling thousands or millions of people to engage in
    deliberative processes that traditionally require small groups.


    Pioneering systems like Polis cluster participant opinions to surface areas of consensus and reveal the structure of
    disagreement. Taiwan's vTaiwan platform has used these tools to engage citizens in policy development on contentious
    issues. Anthropic's Collective Constitutional AI experiment used similar methods to gather public input on how AI
    systems should behave. The core insight is that AI can help identify common ground, summarize diverse viewpoints,
    and translate between different perspectives at scales previously impossible.


    For AI governance, these tools offer a path to democratically legitimate AI policy. Rather than leaving AI
    development decisions to companies or technical elites, deliberation platforms could engage broader publics in
    decisions about how AI should be developed and deployed. For epistemic security, deliberative processes can help
    societies navigate contested questions by surfacing genuine consensus where it exists and clarifying the structure
    of genuine disagreement where it doesn't.

  description: >
    Epistemic infrastructure refers to the foundational systems that societies depend on for creating, verifying,
    preserving, and accessing knowledge. Just as physical infrastructure (roads, power grids) underlies economic
    activity, epistemic infrastructure (archives, scientific publishing, fact-checking networks, educational
    institutions) underlies society's capacity to know things collectively. This infrastructure is under stress and
    requires deliberate investment.


    Current epistemic infrastructure includes elements like Wikipedia (the largest attempt at collaborative knowledge
    creation), the Internet Archive (preserving digital history), academic peer review (verifying scientific claims),
    journalism (investigating and reporting events), and educational systems (transmitting knowledge across
    generations). Each of these faces AI-related threats: Wikipedia can be corrupted with AI-generated misinformation,
    archives struggle to authenticate materials, peer review cannot keep pace with AI-generated fraud, and journalism is
    economically threatened.


    Strengthening epistemic infrastructure requires treating it as a public good deserving of investment. This might
    include: funding for fact-checking organizations and investigative journalism, technical infrastructure for content
    authentication, archives designed for an AI-generated-content world, AI systems explicitly designed to support human
    knowledge creation rather than replace it, and educational programs that teach critical evaluation in an AI context.
    The alternative - letting epistemic infrastructure decay while AI advances - leads to knowledge monopolies, trust
    collapse, and reality fragmentation.

  description: >
    AI-human hybrid systems are designs that deliberately combine AI capabilities with human judgment to achieve
    outcomes better than either could produce alone. Rather than full automation or human-only processes, hybrid systems
    aim to capture the benefits of AI (scale, speed, consistency, pattern recognition) while preserving the benefits of
    human judgment (contextual understanding, values, robustness to novel situations).


    Effective hybrid systems require careful design to avoid the pathologies of both pure automation and nominal human
    oversight. Automation bias leads humans to defer to AI even when AI is wrong. Rubber-stamp oversight gives an
    illusion of human control without substance. The challenge is creating systems where humans genuinely contribute and
    AI genuinely assists, rather than one side dominating or the partnership failing.


    Examples of promising hybrid approaches include: AI systems that flag decisions for human review based on
    uncertainty or stakes, rather than automating all decisions; human-in-the-loop systems where AI drafts and humans
    edit; collaborative intelligence systems where AI and humans have complementary roles; and AI tutoring systems that
    guide rather than replace learning. For AI safety, hybrid systems represent a middle ground between naive confidence
    in human oversight and resignation to full AI autonomy.

  description: >
    Prediction markets use market mechanisms to aggregate beliefs about future events, producing probability estimates
    that reflect the collective knowledge of participants. Unlike polls or expert surveys, prediction markets create
    incentives for truthful revelation of beliefs - participants profit by being right, not by appearing smart or
    conforming to social expectations. This makes them resistant to many of the biases that afflict other forecasting
    methods.


    Empirically, prediction markets have strong track records. They consistently outperform expert panels on questions
    with clear resolution criteria. Platforms like Polymarket, Metaculus, and Manifold generate forecasts on AI
    development, geopolitical events, and scientific questions that often prove more accurate than institutional
    predictions. The Good Judgment Project demonstrated that carefully selected forecasters using prediction market-like
    mechanisms could outperform intelligence analysts with access to classified information.


    For AI governance and epistemic security, prediction markets offer several valuable functions. They can provide
    credible forecasts of AI capability development, helping policymakers time interventions appropriately. They can
    surface genuine expert consensus (or lack thereof) on contested questions. They can create accountability for AI
    labs' claims about safety and timelines. And they can provide a coordination mechanism for collective knowledge that
    is resistant to the manipulation that undermines traditional media and expert systems.

  title: Texas TRAIGA Responsible AI Governance Act
  description: >-
    TRAIGA represents a state-level AI regulation focused on intent-based
    liability for harmful AI practices rather than comprehensive safety
    requirements, creating enforcement mechanisms but avoiding technical safety
    standards. The law establishes useful precedent for AI governance but
    doesn't address

  description: >-
    Timelines Wiki is a specialized MediaWiki project documenting chronological
    histories of AI safety and EA organizations, created by Issa Rice with
    funding from Vipul Naik in 2017. While useful as a historical reference
    source, it primarily serves as documentation infrastructure rather than

  description: >-
    This article provides a comprehensive overview of Wikipedia pageview
    analytics tools and their declining traffic due to AI summaries reducing
    direct visits. While well-documented, it's primarily about web analytics
    infrastructure rather than core AI safety concerns.

  title: US Government Authority Over Commercial AI Infrastructure
  description: >-
    The US government possesses extensive legal authority to direct, commandeer, or access
    the $700B+ in commercial AI infrastructure owned by US companies, through the Defense
    Production Act (priority contracts), CLOUD Act (global data access), FISA 702 (warrantless
    surveillance of non-US persons), IEEPA (emergency commerce regulation), and executive orders.
    Historical precedents include WWII industrial mobilization, post-9/11 PRISM surveillance,
    and COVID-era DPA invocations. Current military-commercial integration (Pentagon contracts
    with Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, xAI; GenAI.mil serving 3M personnel) creates pre-existing
    channels for rapid mobilization.

  title: Goal Misgeneralization Research
  description: >-
    Research into how learned goals fail to generalize correctly to new situations,
    a core alignment problem where AI systems pursue proxy objectives that diverge
    from intended goals when deployed outside their training distribution.
