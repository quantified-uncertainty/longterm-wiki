# Post-Migration Cleanup Tasks

Identified via codebase audit (2026-02-10). Tasks 001–005 have been completed.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Risk |
|---|------|----------|--------|------|
| [006](./006-validation-engine-improvements.md) | Extract shared validation utilities, fix duplication, add tests | Low–Med | ~90–120 min | Low |

## Context

These issues were identified during a deep audit of the codebase after the Astro/Starlight → Next.js 15 migration. The remaining task (006) addresses technical debt in tooling that predates the migration.
